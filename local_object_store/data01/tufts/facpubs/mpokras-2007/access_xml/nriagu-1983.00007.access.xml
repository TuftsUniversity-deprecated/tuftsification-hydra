The absence ofromance in my history will, I fear, detract somewhat from

exact knowledge ofthe past as an aid to the interpretation ofthe

not reflect it, I shall be content.

OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE
Lead poisoning may be regarded as one of the earliest occupational dis 
eases contracted by mankind. The suggestion can be made-rather face 
tiously-that the person who first set his eyes on the birth of metallic lead
from its ore was poisoned by the lead fumes from his furnace or kiln. In
other words, he was chastised for his impertinence. Generations of artisans
throughout antiquity who worked with this dangerous metal received the

same rude treatment without complaint. Polybius (34.9) noted that the
40,000 workers employed in the lead-silver mines near the city of New
Carthage produced roughly 36 metric tons of silver per year-equivalent to
about 12,000 tons of lead output (see Chapter 4). The figures translate into
three occupationally exposed individuals per ton of lead produced. On the
basis of the worldwide production figures in Table 4.1, it is estimated that
on the average, about 80,000 workers engaged in the mining and smelting
of lead were occupationally exposed to lead each year during the time of
the Roman Empire. Also, it may be presumed that it took two other crafts 
men to fashion 1 ton of the lead into the various commercial items. Thus
the total number of workers occupationally exposed to lead during the time
of the Roman Empire is estimated to be about 140,000 per year on the av 
erage. It needs to be remarked that about 40 industries in the United States
employ more than 800,000 workers who are exposed to lead (OSHA, 1978).
The figure of one exposed individual per ton of refined lead produced or
consumed by the highly mechanized contemporary American society sug 
gests that the estimate of about five exposed persons per ton of lead pro 
duced in ancient times may not be very unreasonable. The assumed figure
may not exactly be authentic, but it certainly suggests that large numbers
of ancient workers were occupationally exposed to lead.
As noted in the preceeding chapters, lead found widespread commercial
applications in ancient times. The principal uses for lead are for: nonfer 
rous alloys; pewter and solder; coinage; glass; glazes and enamel; plumb 
ing; stationary; roofs, gutters, and downspouts; burial of the dead; vases,
vessels, and kitchenware; statuettes and figurines; ship building and other
naval purposes; standard weights; projectiles and in warfare; pigments;
medicinal purposes; and food preservatives and colorants. Large segments
of ancient industrial ventures thus used lead in one form or another. Since
there is nothing to suggest that any deliberate efforts were made to curtail
personal exposure to the emissions from the forges and crucibles, it seems
likely that many of the ancient artisans who worked the metal experienced
acute or chronic "plumbism," or lead poisoning. It is certainly not fortui 
tous that no occupational disease has had so much written about it, for so
long, as plumbism.
From the Bronze Age onward, lead-silver mining remained a major in 
dustry that employed large numbers of people in different parts of the
world. Using the data in Table 4.1 and assuming an average career in lead
mines or metallurgy of 10 years, this gives a figure of about 20 million oc 
cupationally exposed persons from the times of remote antiquity to the Fall
of the Roman Empire. In primitive lead mines, the incidence of plumbism
depended on the type of the are, and on the personal hygiene of the
worker. It is now generally accepted that the low incidence of plumbism in
men who work in galena ores is related to the great insolubility of lead sul 
fide in the tissue fluids of the lungs (Rambousek, 1906; Hamilton, 1925;
Waldron and Stofen, 1974). Galena, however, is not exactly nontoxic, and
the incidents of plumbism in "dirty" galena mines and in miners with poor
hygienic dispositions are not usual (Hamilton, 1925; McCord, 1953). It is
easy to see how the ancient slave-miner who crawled and chiseled the
lead-silver ores in the deep galleries could have contracted lead poisoning.
The slave-miner handled it, inhaled particles of it, and had some of it com 
ingle with his meagre diet. In short, the miner wallowed in it. The literary
evidence points to total disregard for the cleanliness of the miners, and
worse still, some of the laborers were apparently forced to live in the mine
shafts (Davies, 1935, p. 16).
Lead poisoning tends to be prevalent in mines where the finer-grained
and more soluble lead-oxide and lead-carbonate ores are exploited. Rela 
tively recent epidemics of lead poisoning associated with the exploitation
of the carbonate ores in many parts of the world attest to this fact (Ham 
ilton, 1925; Rickard, 1932; McCord, 1953; Hunter, 1969). As noted previ 
ously, lead oxides and lead carbonates made up a substantial fraction of
the ores-particularly in the Near East-that were exploited in ancient
times. Pliny (35.19), for example, tells us that ceruse was originally ob 
tained as a natural earth on the land of Theodotus and Smyrna, and that it
was used by the early masters in painting ships. There is no reason to sug 
gest that the ancient miners did not experience as much plumbism as their
counterparts of the last two centuries. The Near Eastern mines certainly
would be a lot drier, dustier, and hence more pernicious to the miners.
It would thus appear that a large fraction of the early miners experi 
enced hazardous exposures to lead. Ancient literary sources are totally si 
lent on the incidence of plumbism among this particular occupational
group. Why? No concrete answer can be given, but the statement by Julius
Pollex (124-192 A.D.) that the miners of his time covered themselves with
bags and sacks or employed bladders to cover their mouths suggests that
the ancient peoples probably knew that the inhalation of the mineral dust
was harmful (Legge, 1934). On a much lighter vein, we are told by Solinus
(Quoted by Agricola, 1556) of a species of deadly insects called "luci 
fuges" that inhabit silver mines principally. These insects resemble spi 
ders, and their bite usually was fatal. Agricola (1556) also alluded to a type
of spirit or specter-known as Knauff Kriegn-that inhabits mines and
frightens and attacks miners. The victims usually die two or three days
after being attacked (Goldwater, 1936). The possibility that the so-called
bites or attacks could at times represent fatal plumbism can be raised, al 
beit rather facetiously.
Subsequently, the lead-silver ores were milled, sorted, and then smelted
in furnaces (jornax, camini) that were usually located near the mines. In
Laurion, Britain, Sardinia, Gaul, and elsewhere, the furnace chimney was
generally small (about 2.5 m), but in Spain, it was high. The lead ingot was
cupelled to part the lead from the silver, and the separated lead then

molded (in formae) into pigs or bullion-the massae plumbae. Each of the
preceding processes exposed the worker to potentially dangerous levels of
lead fumes, dust, and flues.
The greatest potential for high-level exposure to toxic lead fumes is as 
sociated with the process of lead smelting and refining. Until fairly re 
cently, the rate of chronic lead poisoning in lead metallurgical plants was
very high. Prior to 1895, when risk-control measures were introduced, the
cases of lead poisoning among employees of lead smelters in Schemnitz,
Hungary, exceeded 70 percent (quoted in Hamiltion, 1914). A survey of a
"dirty" lead-smelting factory in India found that many of the workers had
chronic lead poisoning (Chakraborty et al., 1964). In 1912, Hamilton found
that about 22 percent of the 7500 workers engaged in lead smelting in the
United States suffered from the same disease (Hamilton, 1925). These
studies pertain to workers in enclosed buildings, and the statistics may not
be readily transferable to ancient workers who obtained their lead using
"boles" on the hillside (see Chapter 2). Nevertheless, the incidence of
plumbism among ancient smelters who attended the furnaces had to be
high. In addition, many copper and zinc ores exploited in ancient times
contained much lead, and since most of the lead "went into the smoke,"
the craftsman who processed these ores could have readily contracted
plumbism also.
There are cogent reasons for suggesting that a large fraction of the pop 
ulation in the lead-silver mining communities received unhealthy doses of
lead. Excavations at Laurion show that the houses and the theater were
jumbled together with washeries, cisterns, adits and shafts, and presumed
slaves' barracks (Hopper, 1968). The following record in the 367-366 B.C.
mine-lease list of the Poletai shows that furnaces and metal workshops
were co-mingled with living quarters and were often used in defining prop 
erty boundaries:
At Laurion, the same Artemissiakon and the cuttings, of which the bounda 
ries are, on the north the property of Diopeithes of Euonymon and the fur 
nace of Demostratos of Kytheros, on the south the workshop [ergasterion]
of Diopeithes and the wagon road, and the ravine of the Thorikioi; the lessee
Kephisodotos of Aithalidai; the price twenty drachmae. (Hopper, 1979,
p. 181)
The smelting and cupellation took place at the higher grounds, and the
noxious lead dusts and fumes generated presumably rained on the inhabit 
ants below. Closely spaced cisterns and washing tables lined the small val 
ley at Laurion (Hopper, 1968), spewing lead into the water supply of the
communities downstream. The mine tailings and slags were used on road 
ways and in hydraulic building construction. An aquarium was cemented
in the dam, and ore-washing sites at Laurion were made of litharge (Wer 
time, 1980). Thus the air, water, and soils around the ancient lead-silver
mines had the potential of being severely contaminated with lead. Most of
the craftsmen apparently lived in the contaminated areas, and it would
seem unlikely, and indeed uneconomical, to transport them daily to their
places of work. An analogy may be drawn here between the ancient com 
munities and the modern residents near stationary sources (smelters, lead 
processing foundries, etc.) of lead where evidence of severe health im 
pairment has been found even in non-industry-employed persons (EPA,
1977).
In Greco-Roman times, the environments around the lead-silver mining
and smelting communities were often considered to be an anathema to
health. Xenophon (Memorabilia 3.6) tells us that the district of the Laurion
silver mines was considered unhealthy and thus unworthy of a visit by
Ariston's son Glaucon. According to Pliny (33.31), the exhalations from
the silver mines are dangerous to all animals, but especially to dogs. Lu 
cretius (De rerum natura, Book VI) provided the following account of the
noxious emanations from the precious-metal mines:
And where there is mining for veins of gold and silver
Which men will dig for deep down in the earth
What stenches arise, as at Scaptensula!
How deadly are the exhalations of gold mines!
You can see the ill effects in the miners' complexions.
Have you not heard and seen how short is the life
Of a miner compelled to remain at this terrible task?
All these exhalations come from the earth
And are breathed forth into the open light of day.
Vitruvius (8.3) spoke of water pollution around the mines and the poten 
tial adverse health implications:
But when gold, silver, iron, copper, lead and the like are mined, abundant
springs are found, but mostly impure. They have the impurities of hot
springs, sulphur, alum, bitumen; and when the water is taken into the body
and, flowing through the vessels, reaches the muscles and joints, it hardens
them by expansion. Therefore the muscles swelling with expansion are con 
tracted in length. In this way men suffer from cramp or gout, because they
have the pores of the vessels saturated with hard, thick and cold particles.
Hippocrates (On Airs, Waters and Places, art. 7) also reckoned that
waters "having iron, copper, silver, gold, sulfur, alum, bitumen or nitre"
(typical of mining effluents) are bad for every purpose, and they are inim 
ical to health.
Del Mar (1880, p. 352) has reviewed the reasons behind the policy of
closing lead-silver mines in ancient times. Among the many social (e.g.,
condemnation of natives to being slave-miners) and economic factors, he
emphasized that environmental quality was equally of great concern:
The physical devastation occasioned by mining for the precious metals must
have furnished to all enlightened nations a strong motive to interdict their use

as money. The mischief done to Lydia, Phrygia, and to the Hedjaz and other
parts of Arabia and Asia Minor, once the leading mining countries of the
world; to Greece, as attested by the vast heaps of scoriae and ekvolades
found near its silver mines; and to ancient Spain through placer and hydraulic
mining; the washing down of mountains, the bestrewal of arable valleys with
stones and sand, the filling of rivers, the choking of harbours, the destruction
of forests and consequent interruption of the rainfall in all these countries 
these and many other damages, the evidences of which can be traced upon
their surfaces or found in their annals, must have arrested the attention of
thoughtful men in ancient times and strongly urged them to the adoption of
the only remedy that promised to prove efficacious. This was the entire in 
terdiction of gold and silver money. That this reason was the basis of the an 
cient Greek laws on the subject there can be little doubt; for most of the
Greek States at one time or another resorted to a numerary currency in the
place of coins. Among these were Sparta, Athens, Ionia, and Byzantium.
When we know that the monopolization of land by the patricians in Upper
Italy was sufficient to arouse the Grachhi and lead to the civil wars which
desolated Rome for a long period, it is difficult to suppose that the devasta 
tion caused by mining was unnoticed, and that no measures were taken to
put an end to it.
Such a notion of environmental awareness may also be linked to what was
perceived as the unhealthy conditions in such mining districts. Will Durant
shared the same sentiments, and in his highly acclaimed work The Story of
Civilization, he astutely observes that "Laurion pays the price of the
wealth is produces, as mining always pays the price for metal industry;
plans and men wither and die from the furnace fumes, and the vicinity of
the works becomes a scene of desolation" (see McCord, 1953, p. 394). The
Roman edict forbidding any mining activities in Italy might have been en 
gendered by the same motive.
. Not only the workers engaged in the mining and smelting of lead were
liable to suffer from lead poisoning, but those individuals also who used
lead in such industries as painting, plumbing, roofing, sculpturing, pewter 
ware making, shipbuilding, enameling, and pottery glazing. A very crude
analogy of plumbism among ancient craftsmen may be drawn from the in 
cidence of occupational plumbism in Paris during the early part of the nine 
teenth century. Of the 1213 patients admitted during the 1830-1838 period
in the Hospital of Charity who&#183; were suffering from lead colic, about 490
were employed in the manufacture of lead compounds, 390 were painters,
61 were potters, 55 were copper and bronze founders, 35 were lapidaries,
25 were refiners, 14 were plumbers, 11 worked in lead-shot factories, and
6 were glazers, while only 2 worked in glass factories (Tanquerel des
Planches, 1848). As noted before, lead was used in these and many other
arts and industries in ancient times, and the craftsmen were equally liable
to have contracted lead poisoning.
The ancient workshops where the lead was processed were, most often,
the backrooms or courtyards of the craftmans' dwellings which was the sit-
uation in the industrial district of Athens (Burford, 1972). The numerous
literary references, the very large number of independent craftsmen whose
names appear on Greco-Roman tombstones, the records of the ancient
guilds of professional crafsmen, and the Attic vase paintings of the fifth and
sixth centuries H.C. all point to the fact that the workshops where the lead
goods were produced remained small-on the whole-throughout antiqiuty
(e.g., see Loane, 1938; Forbes, 1971, pp. 55-103; Burford, 1972). As noted
previously, even the manufacture of the vast numbers of standardized lead
pipes did not entail large factories. During the 15 years of Domitian's rule,
there were only 10 slaves and six freedmen in charge of the shops where
the lead pipes for imperial structures were made (Loane, 1938). Such home
studios present a special hazard to craftsmen that is not found among
workers who labor outside the home. First, there is the possibility of 24 
hour exposure to the lead that may be contaminating the home. Second,
many of craftsmen probably used the kitchen sink and kitchen utensils for
their work, thus risking the contamination of their foods. Occasional
snacking increases the prospect of hand-to-mouth transfer of the lead.
Third, there is the problem of exposing other family members, particularly
the highly susceptible women and children, to lead.
Additional factors that would increase the exposure of ancient craftsmen
and their dependents to lead was the concentration of workshop commu 
nities near the sources of the raw material. Examples include the ancient
Dr towns of Sippar ("town of bronze") and Eridu ("town of smiths") that
were located near the great metals entrepot at Drehem or Puzuris-Dagan
(Forbes, 1971). The other well-known examples are the lead-silver metal 
shops of Attica and the great bronze works of Capua (Loane, 1938). The
street names suggest that even in many ancient cities, each craft had its
own quarter, street, or alley. In the Athenean agora, the heaviest concen 
trations of industrial activity found so far are the lead-using bronze foun 
dries and potters' workshops on and around the site of the Temple of He 
phaistos, dating from ca. the middle of the fifth century B.C. (Burford,
1972). In ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Sumer, Dr, and Assyria, the me 
talworkers commonly were members of guilds that worked under temple
supervision. From the Buddhist texts, we learn that the factories for the
working of base metals were supervised by the lohiidyaksa, or "the in 
spector of the base metals" (Forbes, 1971, p. 96). Any such concentration
of activities pertaining to the processing of lead and lead products may en 
gender the contamination of the immediate occupational environment with
the substance and thus it may represent added risk for the craftsmen and
their dependents.
Pending the publication of Needham's forthcoming monograph, the his 
tory of occupational lead exposure in ancient China remains virtually a
closed book. The classical peoples-certainly the Greeks and Romans 
were aware of the dangers invovled in some of the lead-manufacturing
processes. Pliny (34.49) tells us that "for medical purposes lead is melted
</p>

<p>316 Lead Exposure and Lead Poisoning
Occupational Exposure 317
in earthen vessels, a layer of finely powdered sulfur being put underneath
it. On this, thin plates are laid and covered with sulfur and stirred up with
an iron spit. While it is being melted, the breathing passages should be pro 
tected during the operation, otherwise the noxious and deadly vapor of the
lead furnace is inhaled: it is hurtful to dogs with special rapidity." In de 
scribing the manufacture of red lead, Dioscorides (5.96) recommended
"covering the nostrils, for the vapor is hurtful." And Pliny (33.40) noted
that "persons polishing red lead (or cinnabar) in workshops tie on their
face loose masks of bladder-skin, to prevent their inhaling the dust in
breathing, which is very pernicious, and nevertheless to allow them to see
over the bladders." The following excerpt from Vitruvius (6.7) shows that
he was well aware of the health risks associated with the plumber's
profession:
We can take as example the workers in lead who have complexions affected
by pallor. For when, in casting, the lead receives the current of air, the fumes
from it occupy the members of the body, and burning them thereupon, rob
the limbs of the virtues of the blood.
Acute and chronic plumbism clearly arrived with trade pursuits and manu 
facturing processes involving lead. I am not aware of any literary or other
evidence to suggest that occupational plumbism was recognized as such by
the early (before 1000 B.C.) cultures of India, Mesopotamia, Egypt, and so
forth. The record of occupational plumbism left by Hellenistic writers is
most inadequate. The epithet pallidus was frequently used to describe the
pallor of the miner's complexion (e.g., Pliny, 33.11; Lucan Pharsalia 4;
Statius Silvae 4.7). Rosen (1948) attributed this pallor to bad ventilation
and ankylostomiasis rather than to metal poisoning. The symptomology in
the Hippocratic corpus (Epidemics 6.25), which some authorities (e.g.,
Legge and Goadby, 1912; Aub et al., 1926; Sigerist, 1936; Hunter, 1969) re 
garded as a description of lead colic, pertained to a miner. The brief ref 
erence to the supposed patient with occupational lead poisoning reads
(Littre, 1846; Waldron, 1978): "The man from the mines; right hypochon 
drium strained; enlarged spleen; stomach tense and rather hard; difficulties
with breathing; discoloration, in him, the illness went to the left knee, re 
currence; he was completely examined." Several people have quite rightly
objected to the diagnosis of such a case as lead poisoning (e.g., Stevenson,
1949; Waldron, 1973, 1978). There is nothing in the case history to suggest
that the man worked in a lead-silver mine, and as Stevenson (1949) has
pointed out, the actual term used-metallion-is unqualified, and it can
also refer to an employee in the metallurgical works attached to the mine.
Thus, the only possible reference to occupational plumbism in antiquity re 
mains extremely dubious.
An awareness of the debilitating effects of metal fumes perhaps is In 
grained in the physical attributes of the patron gods of ancient or preliter 
ate craftsmen. In Greek mythology, Hephaistos-a divine smith and patron
of ancient craftsmen-is a pathetic figure, lame and untidy, but he was the
most industrious of all the gods. Vulcan, the Roman god of iron, brass, and
devouring flame, also was ugly, misshapen, and lame (Hunter, 1969). Both
Vulcan and Hephaistos had much in common with the legends of the Teu 
tonic Wieland-a mystical hero of the skilled metalworker-who was lame,
the Scandinavian Volunder, and the Finnish smith-god, Ilmarinen (see
Forbes, 1971). It is said that the craftsmen of many prehistoric cultures
were cripples or pygmies (Forbes, 1971). This occupational calling presum 
ably appealed to those persons incapable of becoming warriors or success 
ful farmers. Rosner (1953) has suggested that the mythological link was
forged by the fact that the Anatolian metallurgists of the third millennium
B.C. generally experienced chronic arsenic poisoning from the smelting of
arsenical copper ores or arsenic-copper alloys, which led to arseneuritis
and lameness of the extremities. Such an idea may be farfetched, but the
very widespread association of a special deformity with a particular occu 
pation has to be very suggestive. The heavy metal ores are characteristi 
cally multimetallic, and the debilitating effects of lead from such ores
would certainly not enhance the image of craftsmen in such occupational
callings.
Considering the very impressive usage of lead, particularly in Roman
times, it is rather strange that the classical literary records are nearly silent
regarding the incidence of occupational plumbism in those days. This mat 
ter is particularly vexatious, considering that the dangerous nature of some
of the saturnine trades was generally recognized. Stevenson (1949) has dis 
cussed the question in great detail and has offered three suggestions:
(1) the conditions of work reduced the occupational risk; (2) those who
were most constantly and dangerously exposed to the hazards of lead
(namely slave workers and lowly artisans) did not move in the higher world
of the doctors who wrote the books; and (3) the requisite passages in the
ancient medical literature have not survived. Stevenson (1949, pp. 84-85)
concluded his discussions with the following astute observation:
It is apparent that a clear-cut social thesis regarding ancient knowledge of
plumbism cannot be maintained. Vitruvius is our principal witness and it is
difficult to decide the meaning of his testimony, as against the near silence of
the medical authors. The latter may have seen and recognized chronic
plumbism of occupational origin. At the same time it would be surprising if
the physician of antiquity had devoted much of his energy to a disease that
was merely occupational. The motive of Christian charity was lacking; the
social atmosphere was never democratic in the modern sense; a slave was
thought to be less than human; to work for a living was considered degrad 
ing. Why should a physician concern himself, except incidentally, with oc 
cupational disease? It is perhaps no accident that the majority of the refer 
ences to occupational disease in general are found in non-medical writers.
It is doubtful, though, that the ancient physicians and technologists were
ever able to associate any disease conditions with the lead trade and in-

dustry. If they did, the dietary exposure would certainly have been cur 
tailed and the question as to whether the Roman Empire declined as a re 
sult of lead poisoning would never have arisen.
NONOCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE
Like today, the circumstances under which the ancient peoples were ex 
posed to lead poisoning are legion, often bizarre, and sometimes dramatic.
The unusual routes of lead exposure would have included the following:
1. Lead coins and debased bronze or brass coins, when handled exces 
sively, mouthed, or inadvertently swallowed.
2. To ward off evil, the ancient spell-seeker at times wrote the message
on "paper" with red lead, which symbolized blood, burned the talis 
man, and swallowed the ashes. The answer to his imprecation would
have come in the form of lead colic.
3. Many yarns were treated with lead salts as makeweight-the hazard
here may be more to the workmen than to the wearer.
4. Children's toys, many of which are made of lead (see Chapter 4).
5. Candleholders and wickholders made of lead or pewter could be par 
tially evaporated in burning.
6. Houses were sometimes coated with leaden pigments, and the possi 
bility of childhood pica cannot be completely discounted.
7. The application of lead ointments to the breasts and leaden rouge to
the body constituted a hazard to the suckling infants.
8. Lead paintwork in public places.
No attempt will be made to deal with exposure from such adventitious
sources; the subsequent discussions will address only the principal expo 
sure routes to lead in ancient times.
Exposure from Cosmetics
As. noted in Chapter 5, the use of galena in medicinal or cosmetic prepa 
rations can be traced to very ancient times. This mineral, in unprocessed
form or as very fine compacted or loose powder (known in Arabic as kohl),
hasbee~found in ancient graves in Egypt, the lower Indus Valley, pre 
Columbian North America, and other places. In ancient Egypt, as in sev 
eral. present-day West African cultures, the kohl was used to provide pro 
tection against the so-called Egyptian eye disease and as magic to make
the eyes larger and brighter. It is not clear to what an extent such saturnine
mascara constituted a health hazard; its continuous use over an extended
period of time could induce chronic lead poisoning. A recent study ob-
serves that "an unusual source of poisoning in the United Kingdom is as 
sociated with the use of eye-cosmetics (particularly, surma, which contains
up to 88% lead sulfide) by Asian families. Between 1966 and 1971, of 38
children in Birmingham with lead poisoning, 15 were Asians" (DOE,
1974). Since the children were not recognized as having pica, it was sur 
mised that they instilled the lead into the conjuctival sac from which the
absorption occurred (Snodgrass et al., 1973). Srivastava and Varadi (1968)
also reported one case of plumbism in an adult that was caused by the use
of saturnine mascara, and another case from the use of lipstick cream con 
taining 67% white lead.
Von Baeyer claimed that the ancient Egyptians prepared their eye ink
by using charcoal to calcine the lead sulfate that was made by converting
metallic lead into litharge, dissolving the litharge in vinegar, and precipi 
tating the sulfate with an alum solution tGmelins, 1973). Unless strict hy 
gienic conditions were observed, the persons engaged in'such a prepara 
tion process also ran a high risk of getting lead poisoning.
Lead compounds long have been used for artificial darkening of hair
color-the lead reacts with the -SH functional groups in the hair to form
black-lead sulfides in the hair shaft. Such saturnine hair dyes might have
been quite popular with the women of ancient Italy and the Middle East,
who were, in general, dark haired. Pliny (28.191) spoke of a soap ("litharge
of silver' ') "for reddening hair, which was available both in solid and liquid
form, and which was used in Germany, more by men than the women."
During the Middle Ages, equal parts oflitharge, burnt lime, and chalk were
used in the form of a thick paste that was left in the hair overnight (Grand 
jean, 1975). The study by Bagchi (1969) suggests that the use of saturnine
hair dyes can be dangerous. He found a common occurrence of chronic
lead poisoning among the Hindu women of Bengal, and its neighboring dis 
tricts, who applied sindur (red lead mixed with a red synthetic dye) to the
anterior end where they parted their hair. It has been suggested (Bagchi,
1969; Sagarin, 1957) that the use of hair oil helped the lead to be in contact
with the skin by forming lipid-soluble lead soap (with the fatty acids of veg 
etable origin), which thus favors absorption. The hand-to-mouth transfer of
the lead cannot be ruled out, however. In an experiment with adult volun 
teers, Marzulli and associates (1977) found a fourfold to tenfold increase in
lead concentrations on auxiliary and pubic hair following the application of
2% lead-acetate hair dyes for 90 days. They concluded that lead-absorption
can occur from the scalp. The recent case histories using sophisticated an 
alytical methods thus show that saturnine mascara was an unsafe product.
These recent histories point to the ancientko~lsas being potentially deadly
poisons.
The use of white lead to enhance the skin tone, to cover pockmarks,
freckles, and blemishes, and to enhance one's sex appeal by being used
occasionally on breasts was quite widespread in ancient times (see Chapter
1). Red lead also often was an ingredient in concoctions used to impart a

rosy color to cheeks, while lead oxides were often used in yellow pigments
for the adornment of the foreheads of ancient Chinese ladies. The common
use of such compounds suggests that there was a real danger of transfer 
ring the lead from the face, body, or container to the hands, and subse 
quently to the mouth. Lead absorption can also take place through intact
skin, but the extent depends on the lead compound used and the condition
of the skin (Mahaffey, 1978). After the cutaneous application of lead 
acetate and lead-naphthenate solutions to the back of the rats' necks, Ras 
togi and Clausen (1976) found highly elevated concentrations of lead in the
kidneys, livers, and muscles, which strongly suggests the absorption of the
lead compounds through the intact skin of rats. Lipid-soluble lead salts can
be absorbed readily through intact skins. Thus, products that contain oint 
ments, oily bases, and surface-active agents that can form lipid-soluble
lead soaps will enhance the absorbability of the lead. Even the fatty acids
typically found in the sebum and on the skin can react with the inorganic
lead to form soaps that can be more readily absorbed (Sagarin, 1957). The
fact that lead can be readily absorbed through broken skin and excoriated
parts has been known for a long time (see Baker, 1767; Tanquerel des
Planches, 1848).
These&#183; recent studies thus suggest that chronic lead poisoning, stemming
from cosmetic use of various lead compounds in ancient times, was prob 
ably much more widespread than has hitherto been recognized. The health
implications of storing beauty aids in lead vessels are not clear. Martial
(6.55) referred to the use of leaden jars for perfumes. Theophrastus (En 
quiry into Plants, and Minor Works, art. 41) observed that the worst that
can happen to perfume "is that they should be deprived oftheir proper heat.
This is why men put them into vessels of lead . . . for lead is cold and of
closed texture, (and thus) neither lets the odor pass away through them,
nor do they take in anything." As noted in several sections before, lead
lids were frequently used where the vessels needed to be hermetically
sealed.
Exposure from Drinking Water
The contamination of ancient drinking water comes principally from the
use of lead pipes, lead-based solders, lead-pewter vats, lead-lined cisterns,
as well as pewter and leaded bronze kettles (see Chapter 4). As discussed
previously, the Romans were the first to make an impressive use of lead
pipes in their water-distribution systems. The level of their exposure to
lead that can be attributed to their plumbing systems has been a matter of
long-standing debate and interest (e.g., Girolamo Mercuriale, 1588; Baker,
1767; Kobert, 1909; Stevenson, 1949; Gilfillan, 1965; Hodge, 1981). The
question has remained fairly intractable because the available evidence
yields conflicting clues on the plumbosolvency of the water supplies in
Rome.
What, then, are the factors influencing the lead concentrations in the
water supplies of ancient Rome?
Alkalinity and pH
Soft waters (alkalinity of 0-25 mg/liter CaC0
3
) with moderately low pH
(below 6.5) are particularly corrosive to lead pipes, and the numerous in 
cidents of acute plumbism from drinking such lead-piped waters attest to
this (Moore, 1977). The alkalinity and pH of the water supplies in Rome
cannot now be determined unambiguously. Rome relied almost exclusively
on springs as the source of her water. These are now lost in the mists of
time (see Table 6.1). Learned discussions on the possible sources of the
waters delivered to ancient Rome have been presented by Lanciani (1888,
1897), Asby (1935), and Van Deman (1973). Stated briefly, few-if any-of
these source springs have been identified unambiguously.
Rome itself is situated on calcareous rocks and the present-day munici 
pal water is quite hard, averaging about 300 mg/liter CaC0
3
(Amulree,
1973). The thick limestone encrustations on the remains of many ancient
aqueducts (Asby, 1935; Van Deman, 1973) and the fact that the systems
were cleaned frequently by the circuitores suggest that the aqueducts suf 
fered from serious calcareous deposits. Using this line of reasoning,
Forbes (1964, p. 177) has concluded that "the manifold cases of rather in 
tense incrustations of calcium carbonate on the interior of ancient lead
pipes suggest that this complaint (of possible lead poisoning) is grossly
overrated."
The area around Rome, however, contains other geological rock forma 
tions (see Lanciani, 1897). The principal ones include: (1) argillaceous beds
that are conspicuous in the Vatican and Janiculum ridges and are used
widely as an essential element of Roman masonry; (2) the volcanic rocks
exemplified in the Alban hills and the Sabatine volcanic range. The tufa,
pozzolana, and selce were extensively employed in Roman buildings and
in making cement (67% pozzolana and 33% lime); and (3) alluvial deposits
that abound on each side of the Tiber River (Lanciani, 1897, pp. 5-6). Vol 
canic rocks generally made good aquifers, and in fact, the head springs of
Aqua Appia, Aqua Virgo, Aqua Trajana, and Aqua Alexandrina are be 
lieved to be from possibly noncalcareous rocks (Lanciani, 1897; Ashby, 1935;
Van Deman, 1973). Waters in contact with noncalcareous volcanic rocks
are noted for being soft and relatively acidic, that is, corrosive to the lead
pipe. In this respect, it is significant that the four above-mentioned aque 
ducts accounted for about 25% of the water consumed .daily in ancient
Rome. (This conclusion is taken from the supply figures given by
Frontinus).

312 B.C. 704 The source of the original aqueduct lay within the bounds of the vast estate
of Lucullus (ager Lucullanus), between seven and eight miles from the
city, 780 paces (1)53.62 m) along a crossroad to the left of the Via Prae 
nestina (Frontinus, 1:5), or probably, as Lanciani (1878) suggests, of the
Via Colatina. The exact site of the springs, which were selected doubtless
for their proximity to the city as well as for the excellent quality of their
water, cannot now be determined, though their general location is clear.
They lie, as in the time of Appius Claudius, in a level stretch of marsh-land
rich in springs fed from the slopes of the Alban hills. The source of the
later branch of the conduit, the Ramus Augustae, which was located more
than a mile nearer the city than that of the older branch, was to be found,
according to Frontinus (1:5), on a crossroad 980 paces 0,450.5 m.) to the
left of the Via Praenestina. Its site has not so far been identified.
272 B.C. 1610 Concerning the site of the intake, no information has been handed down to
us by ancient writers, apart from the statement of Frontinus (l :6) that it
lay above Tibur at the twentieth milestone from the ... Gate, where it
gave a portion of its water to supply the people of the town. The exact
point to which the words of Frontinus refer has been, from the time of
Canina, the subject of much, though fruitless, discussion.
52 B.C. 5625 The main source of the aqueduct was, as is indicated by its name, also the
Anio river. Its intake lay, in the time of Claudius, somewhat higher up than
that of the Anio Vetus, at the forty-second milestone of the Via Sublacen 
sis (Frontinus 1.15). When, however, despite the insertion of a settling
tank below the intake, the water brought to the city remained dirty and
unpalatable, the intake was removed, by the orders of Trajan, farther up
the river beyond Subiaco, where the waters were drawn from Nero's
lakes, which served as a vast storage and clearing tank. In order to render

still more wholesome the waters of the aqueduct, the Rivus Herculaneus
was added as a supplementary source, near the thirty-eighth milestone on
the road to Subiaco.
The original source, or fans, of the Marcia was situated, as stated by Fron 
tinus (1.7), beside a crossroad three miles to the right of the thirty-sixth
milestone of Via Valeria as one comes from Rome, where its waters lay
like a quiet pool of a deep green hue. While the general location of the
source of the conduit is certain, the changes wrought in the floor of the
valley by nature during the two milleniums which have passed have buried
springs themselves far below the modern level. Augustus added to the orig 
inal conduit a second source bearing his name, the Aqua Augusta, a fitting
rival of the older source, not only in the excellence of its water but in its
abundance (Frontinus 1:12). For not only was the volume of the earlier aq 
ueduct doubled by it, but out of its surplus water, the Claudia also was
filled to overflowing (Frontinus 1:14; 2:72). The exact site of the springs of
the Augusta is unknown. According to Frontinus (1:12), however, they lay
above those of the Marcia, 800 paces (1,187 m.), from the junction of the
two channels. In accordance with the Roman custom, Caracalla added to
the Marcia, in 212 A.D., in compensation for the water drawn from it for
his baths, a new fountain-head, the Fons Antoninianus, which was re 
garded later as an independent conduit and called the Aqua Antoniniana,
or Jovia (Lanciani, 1878). In addition to its more regular sources, the Mar 
cia, in times of crisis, drew also a supplementary supply of water from the
nearby spring of the Claudia, the Fons Albudinus, the excellence of which
equaled that of the older aqueduct itself (Frontinus, 1:14).
The source of the conduit, according to Frontinus (l :9), is "on a crossroad
two miles to the right of the Latin Way as one comes from Rome, at the
twelfth milestone from the city." The general site as indicated by Fron 
tinus was located by Lanciani in 1878, according to whom it lay in the re 
gion already famous for its springs, the Ager Lucullanus, in the valley in

which the source of the Tepula had been discovered almost a century ear 
lier. The individual springs, several in number (ex pluribus adquisitioni 
bus), the union of which formed the caput, or fountain-head, of the conduit
(Frontinus, 7:69) cannot, however, be identified with certainty, though
those pointed out by Lanciani seem open to little doubt. To these legiti 
mate sources, the watermen (aquarii) of the following century fraudulently
added a considerable part of the brook called the Crabra, belonging by
rights to the people of Tusculum, the line of which passed close by the
springs of the aqueduct-an abuse corrected by Frontinus in accordance
with the orders of the Emperor Trajan (Frontinus, 7:9). The supply of
water furnished by the conduit was later increased by the addition of 162
quinariae (6,723 cubic meters in twenty-four hours), which it received from
the Cubia behind the Gardens of Pallas in the city (Frontinus, 2:69).
The original source of the conduit, the tiny lake of Martignano, lies a little
to the northeast of the larger lake of Bracciano (facus Sabatinus), on a
crossroad six and a half miles to the right of the Via Claudia at the four 
teenth milestone from Rome (Frontinus, 1:11). A supplementary.supply of
water was added, when the water inspectors (aquarii) considered it neces 
sary, from lake Bracciano or from its outlet, the Arrone, by a branch chan 
nel which joined the main conduit at Careiae (Frontinus, 2:71).
in the part of the valley of the Anio river below Arsoli where the noted
springs of the Marcia were located, the engineers of Claudius found two
other springs a short distance higher up which vied with if they did not
surpass the earlier ones in the rich abundance of their waters (Frontinus,
2:72), while but a little inferior to them in quality. The site of these
springs, which bore the names offons Caeruleus, from the celestial blue of
its water, and fans Curtius, was located, according to Frontinus (Fron-
tinus, 1:14), at the thirtyeighth milestone of the Sublacensian Way. Ow 
ing, however, to the varied vicissitudes through which the bed of the val 
ley has passed, the actual site of the springs as well as of the collecting
basin (caput aquarum) cannot now be determined. To these two fountain 
heads was added, a little later, a third, called the fans Albudinus, the water
of which was so excellent that, when united with the Marcia as a supple 
mentary source, the latter suffered no deterioration in quality from the ad 
mixture. The precise location of the Albudinus is not known, though it is
clear that it lay at no great distance from the other sources of the aqueduct.
Abundant as were the three earlier sources, the public and private de 
mands on the Claudia made a still further supply of water necessary. The
waters of the Augusta; which had been designed by Augustus as a supple 
mentary source for the Marcia only, were in part, therefore, turned into
the channel of the Claudia, with the understanding, however, that the lat 
ter should receive only the surplus water which the Marcia could not
carry. Though the site of the springs of the Augusta is not known, ancient
references make it clear that it lay well above those of the Marcia not far
from the Claudia.

Aqua Trajana 109 A.D.
The system of the Trajana, apart from its multiplicity of sources, is simple.
The groups of fountain-heads, each consisting of several distinct springs,
from which it drew its water lay in the hilly regions to the north between
the shores of the lake of Bracciano and the villages of Oriolo and Bassano.
They were, according to Cassio, five in number: the springs of (1) the
Fosso di Fiora, (2) Grugnale near Oriolo, (3) Ceresaro near Bassano,
(4) the Fossa della Spina, and (5) the Ferriera. The head-reservoir, or col 
lecting basin, the caput aquae of the Romans, lay somewhat farther down
between Vicorelle and Trevignano.

The literary evidence generally suggests that a large fraction of the
water supply to the city of ancient Rome was relatively soft. Ancient Ro 
mans believed strongly in Hippocrates' adjudication that "water contrib 
utes much towards health." Thus they eschewed all sources of water that
Hippocrates (On Airs, Water and Places, arts. 7-8) claimed to be bad, no 
tably "waters that are marshy, stagnant and belong to lakes; waters which
have their fountains in rocks or from a soil which produces ephemeral ther 
mal waters 'which must necessarily be hard'; and waters from snow and
ice 'the worst of any for all purposes whatsoever.' " As is evident from
Table 6.1, they sought for the best potable waters, "which are those that
flow from elevated grounds, and hills of earth; these are sweet, clear and
can bear a little wine; they are hot in summer and cold in winter, for such
necessarily must be waters from deep wells." Whether the springs tapped
by the Romans originated from deep-seated, noncalcareous aquifers can
only be guessed at. Many later Roman authors noted that good potable
waters "can bear a little wine;" and it would seem that the Romans were
able to estimate roughly the alkalinity of their water by dosing it with a
strongly colored wine (vitis faecenia) of the Algerian type (see Forbes,
1964, and references cited therein), Such a test can be expected to work
only in soft to moderately alkaline waters.
The Romans believed that the potable water should be properly tested
and Vitruvius (8.4) recommended the following: "The water, being sprin 
kled over a vessel of Corinthian or any other good bronze, should leave no
trace. Or if the water is boiled in a copper vessel and is allowed to stand
and then poured off, it will also pass the test, if no sand or mud is found in
the bottom of the copper vessel." There is little doubt that very hard
waters are unlikely to pass such tests. Furthermore, both Hippocrates and
Vitruvius stress that boiled vegetables should not be "hardened" by water.
Vitruvius (8.6) and Palladius also recommended the addition of mineral
salts to purify waters that contained too much lime.
An additional hint on the relative softness of the water supply in ancient
Rome can be derived from the classification by Celsus (2.18):
Rain water is the lightest, then the spring water, next water from the river,
then from a well, after that from snow ice; heavier still is water from a hike,
the heaviest from a marsh. The recognition of the quality of water is as easy
as it is necessary for those who want to know its nature. For by weighing,
the lightness of water becomes evident, and of water of equal weight, that is
better which most quickly heats or cools, also in which pulse is most quickly
cooked.
It is thus not surprising that by the time the aqueducts were fully devel 
oped, those systems that derived their waters from surface sources and
ephemeral springs (e.g., Aqua Aliestina, Aqua, Anio Vetus, and the origi 
nal Anio Novus [see table 6.1] were generally considered unpalatable and
were used primarily for water mills, water shows (naumachia), and sewer
flushing (Leake, 1930; Forbes, 1964; Amulree, 1973). Such waters-from

were numerous springs around Rome, what, then, was sospec~alabout t?e
few that were tapped for the aqueducts, some ofthe~atco~sIderabledIS 
tances from Rome? Did the Romans seek out the spnngs with soft waters
in order to obviate the problem of calcareous deposits? There is also the
question of the widespread use of the water supplies in the thermopolia
where the hot water was prepared for the baths and for sale. Was any de 
liberate attempt made to ameliorate the scaling problem by relying on the
supply of relatively soft water? Perhaps there was.
Temperature
The solubility of calcite decreases with temperature (see Garrels and
Christ, 1965). Thus, heating tends to reduce the carbonate alkalinity of the
waters. The winter temperatures of the source springs for Aqua Marcia,
Aqua Julia, and Aqua Tepula have been estimated to be 45&#176;F,5O-52~F,
and 61-63&#176;F, respectively (Lanciani, 1888; Ashby, 1935). Such sprmg
waters when they are cooled to ambient temperatures, may be expected
to have lower alkalinity than surface waters. Furthermore, a reduction in
carbonate alkalinity often entails a reduction in pH. Hot waters with pH
values below neutral are known to be particularly corrosive to lead pipes
(Pocock, 1980). The high plumbosolvency of such hot and acidic waters
has been known for a very long time. Pausanias (4.35) noted that in his
time "a hot spring has been found at Dicaearchia Puteolis so acid that in
a few years it dissolved the lead through which its water passed."
Duration in Pipe and First-Draw Water
The channels of the Roman aqueducts were lined with rough-cut stone,
tufa, sand, or concrete. The claim by Pirro Ligorio in the sixteenth century
that the channel of Aqua Virgo was lined with lead sheet in marshy places
has been disputed (see Ashby, 1935, p. 171). The water in the aqueduct
arrived at the castellae (tanks) from which it was conveyed, often in lead
pipes, to the consumer. Since the Roman water supply worked on the prin 
ciple of constant offtake, the castellae had little storage capacity, thus im 
plying constant flow of water through the pipes to the withdrawal points.
Frontinus (2.111) tells us that "there must necessarily be some overflow
from reservoirs, this being proper not only for the health of our city, but
also for use in the flushing of sewers." Water, however, was piped into the
villas and ground floors of the tenement blocks (insulae) where the aristo-
crats usually lived. Tenants of the upper floors of the insulae obtained their
water from the nearest fountains or the water carriers (aquarii) (Carcopino,
1940). Thus the high concentrations of lead that characterize first-draw
water (e.g., see Wong and Berrang, 1976) would have been a problem only
to the affluent to whom the emperor had granted supplies (sub nomine Cae 
saris), During the time of Frontius (ca. 35-103 A.D.), there were over
14,000 taps affixed directly to the castellae, and there were many other un 
registered ones connected to the supply lines in Rome. These outlets, usu 
ally made of bronze, fed the lead pipes that then conducted the water to
the aediles, which were often located at considerable distance from the
castellae.
It would thus appear that a certain fraction of the water supply to the
ancient city of Rome was relatively soft. The plumbosolvency of such
waters, however, could have been mitigated by several factors. The water
supply worked on the principle of constant offtake, implying a compara 
tively short contact time with the lead in the distribution system. The afflu 
ent households supplied with piped-in water were probably large, required
a lot of water, and conceivably reduced the build-up of lead in the tap
water.
To put things further into perspective, it needs to be noted, that out of
the 95 larger aqueducts in service during the Roman Empire, only 9 or so
were located in the capital city of Rome itself (Leger, 1875; Forbes, 1964).
In Asia Minor, there were major aqueducts in Sardis, Ephesos, Pergamon,
Miletus, N ysa, and Smyrna, and Spain had large aqueducts at Merida and
Segovia. In Gaul there were famous ones at Nimes, Arles, and Lyons,
while Germany and Britian were served by the aqueducts of Cologne,
Bonn, Mainz, Trier, Lincoln, Dorchester, Sulis, and so forth (see Chapter
4 for references). Most of these aqueducts were equipped with lead plumb 
ing that at times carried highly corrosive soft waters. The universality of
lead plumbing during the Roman Empire suggests that the urban popula 
tions of the provinces with soft waters were probably exposed to much
higher levels of lead in their drinking waters compared to those who lived
in the city of Rome. The city of Pompeii is another interesting example.
Because of the great head of the ancient aqueduct, the water could be
forced to the castellae located in the highest parts of the city. The city had
only a few mains, and private citizens were forced to tap theirwate~di 
rectly from the castellae and convey it over long distances. Lead pipes
were used everywhere to pipe the water to all but the poorest homes.
Some of the private houses had as many as 30 taps (Mau, 1902).
Leaden Water Tanks
It has already been noted (Chapter 4) that lead vats and cisternsw~re~x&#173;
tensively used in ancient times for storing water. Petrie (1920) mamtams
that large water tanks lined with lead were in use in Egyptsin~eca. 600
B.C. Such lead containers, which were particularly common In Roman

times, represented a health hazard, especially if the corrosive types of
water were stored in them. Many ancient examples are also known (see
Chapter 4) where lead sheets were used in roofing, in flashings, and to line
the drains to the water tanks. Such usage would have contributed some
lead to the drinking water. Indeed, as early as the sixth century A.D., Ae 
tics (4.1.78) implicated the rainwater from a lead roof as a cause of
dysentery.
If the ancient peoples recognized the inherent dangers of lead pipes,
they made no attempts to discourage their use. The references to lead
pipes in Pliny, Frontinius, and Vitruvius show clear matter-of-fact tones.
Vitruvius (8.6) certainly made an important observation when he stated:
Water supply by earthenware pipes has these advantages. First, if any fault
occurs in the work, anybody can repair it. Again, water is much more whole 
some from earthenware pipes than from lead pipes. For it seems to be made
injurious by lead, because white lead is produced by it; and this is said to be
harmful to the human body. Thus if what is produced by anything is inju 
rious, it is not doubtful but that the thing is not wholesome in itself.
We can take example by the workers in lead who have complexions affected
by pallor. For when, in casting, the lead receives the current of air, the fumes
from it occupy the members of the body, and burning them thereupon, rob
the limbs of the virtues of the blood. Therefore it seems that water should
not be brought in lead pipes if we desire to have it wholesome. Our daily
table may show that the flavour from earthenware pipes is better, because
everybody even when they pile up their tables with silver vessels, for all
that, uses earthenware to preserve the flavour of water.
The repetitious use of "it seems" suggests that he was only guessing about
the possible danger of lead pipes, based on his familiarity with the inci 
dence of palsy among the lead workers and his understanding of the tox 
icity of white lead. He referred to the earthenware pipes as "cheap," and
the rest of his text leaves no doubt as to his preference for lead pipes in
major water-supply systems. Much later, Palladius (De re rustica 9.11) also'
noted that lead pipes make the water injurious because "ceruse, which is
harmful to the human body, is a product of the attrition of the lead." He
was probably quoting from Vitruvius.
In his letter to Fuscus ("lover of the city"), Horace ("lover of the coun 
try") asked: "Is the water purer, which in city streets struggles to burst its
leaden pipes,' than that which dances and purls down the slobing brook?"
(Epistles 1.10). As Stevenson (1949) has pointed out, this statement repre 
sents more a poetic fancy than a condemnation of lead pipes per se. Galen
(8.45) seems to be the only ancient medical authority to have expressed
any reservation against the use of lead pipes. After recommending pure
r rainwater as the most proper for the preparation of his confectio ex capi 
tibus papaveris, he particularly directs that water flowing through leaden
pipes is to be avoided "for a certain slime from. the lead is present in it.
Andfor this reason those who drink the sediment of such water are subject
to disorders in the intestines." Galen, however, forgot to stress that the
rainwater should not be collected from roofs weathered with lead sheets,
or that the concoction itself should not be boiled in leaden kettles or pots.
Athenaus actually alluded to possible colic from drinking water boiled in
bronze or lead kettles: "A small cup of boiled water, if he drank it raw, it
sits heavily and causes pain" (Deipnosophistae 3.122). Or again: "Let me
not see anyone boiling water in a kettle for me. There's nothing the matter
with me. Heaven forbid! But if I get a twist in my belly or navel, I've got
a charm which I bought of Phertatus...." iDeipnosophistae 3.122).
Pliny's (14.29) assertion "man is so skillful in flattering his vices, that
he has even found means to render water poisonous" rings so true, but
it was not aimed at lead pipes.
Exposure from Foods
Elevation of lead concentration may occur in foods that are grown near
ancient base-metal mining communities. Exposure from such a source,
however, would have been a local problem for a population presumably
overburdened with lead from other exposure sources.
The principal sources of lead in ancient foods included the. contamina 
tion and adulteration of the food during processing, leaching from lead,
pewter, or bronze utensils, improperly glazed pottery used in storing or
cooking the foods, use of lead-containing preservatives and colorants, and
from condiments and seasonings adulterated with lead. Lead in cooking
water and dining utensils may also be transferred to the diet. The exposure
from lead-contaminated beverages will be discussed later. . .
Lead vessels, as well as pewter and leaded bronze vessels and utensils,
were in use in the Old World since remote antiquity (see Chapter 4). As
noted previously, the peculiarity of ancient Chinese bronzes was their con 
.'sistent high percentage of lead. The cooking vessels used in ancient China,
. such as ting , li, and hu (probably for boiling and simmering-stewing), and
hsien, tseng, andfu (for steaming), were made of pottery, lead, andJeaded
bronze (Chang, 1973; Linduff, 1977; Schafer, 1977; Yu, 1977). For exam 
ple, seven bronze fu vessels with a lot of fish bones were discovered in
Han tombs in Canton (Mai, 1958), and from Han tombs at Li-Chu and
Shao-hsing in Chekiang a number of bronze, pottery, and iron fu were
I 'unearthed in 1955 (Yu, 1977). The lead and bronze cook.ing vessels cer 
tainly would have contributed lead to the foods-s-especially when they
were employed in preparing acidic foods-or if the pots were scraped oc 
casionally to prevent burning, as is usually the case with thick liquids. A
suggestion of the magnitude of leached-out lead comes from an eighteenth 
century English bronze plate containing 3% lead that emitted 0.15 mg lead/
dm- in an acetic acid test (Grandjean, 1975). By comparison, it is not rare
for ancient Chinese bronze vessels to contain over 30% lead. Old Chinese

<p>sources, however, are remarkably silent on lead poisoning from cooking
vessels. . . f .
There was a marked dichotomy in the composition 0 pre-Han servmg
utensils and vessels. Vessels for grain, such as kui, hsu, fu, and tui, were
pewter-bronze, lead, pottery, and basketry, while those for dishes, such as
tou, pien, and tsu, were mostly made of wood orba~kets(Cha~g,1977).
Tou and pien, the two most important vessels for serving meat dishes, are
not known to be made of bronze or lead during the Shang and Early Chou
periods. Tou vessels appeared in the latter half of the Chou erai~bronze,
but from the beginning of the Han epoch onward, they were agam almost
exclusively wooden or lacquered. Chang (1977) speculates that food and
drinks were cognitively classified during the Shang and Chou periods into
different categories similar to the five elements (see Chapter 1), and differ 
ent vessel materials could only come into contact with certain kinds of
foods and drinks, according to specific rules. Irrespective of its exact sig 
nificance, such a dualistic principle would have curtailed the dietary intake
of lead by the rich, who could afford meat and rich vegetable dishes.
Lead, pewter, leaded bronze, and lead-repaired vessels have also been
found in the remains of the ancient cultures of India, Mesopotamia, the
Levant, Persia, Egypt, among others (see Chapter 4). In addition, lead was
frequently used in antiquity for mending broken pottery. The Romans,
however, were the first to popularize the use of lead, pewter, and leaded
bronze utensils on a grand scale. "The remarkable thing about lead ves 
sels," writes Pliny (34.49) is that "they will not melt if they have water put
in them, but a hole is burnt in the same vessels if filled with pebbles or
copper coins instead of water." The bronze of Campania, "which is most
esteemed for utensils," contained 8-10 lb of lead per 100 lb of copper
(Pliny 34.20). Pot-bronze was a blend of 3-4lb of lead and 100 lb of copper
(Pliny 34.20). Furthermore, it was common practice for the Greeks and
Romans to coat their copper or bronze cooking pots with lead or lead al 
loys. Pliny (34.48) says that "when copper vessels are coated with stagnum
(a lead-silver or lead-tin-copper alloy) the contents have a more agreeable
taste and the formation of destructive verdigris is prevented, and, what is
remarkable, the weight is not increased."
Large hoards of Roman utensils are extant, particularly from the exca 
vations of Pompeii, where several kitchens have been found that were ap 
parently in use at the time of the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 A.D. For ex 
ample, a set of bronze saucepans (caccabus?, or abenum), presumably
coated originally with stagnum, has been found in situ on the hearth in the
kitchen of the House of Vettii at Pompeii (Liversidge, 1957). Roman
bronze (often leaded) and pewter frying pans (fretale, sartago, patellae, or
patinae), bowls for bain-marie cooking, cooking pots (ollas) , and strainers
(colae) are widespread, and exemplary hoards have been found at several
sites in Pompeii, and at Gneisenau, Germany, Pannonia, Newstead, Scot 
land, several locations in Britain (Liversidge, 1957), and at Olynthus (Ro-
I

binson, 1941). Such utensils would have been relatively important sources
of dietary lead intake, and recent cases of lead poisoning from such
sources are indeed recorded in the medical literature (e.g., see Mahaffey,
1978 for a review).
The Romans typically served their.food on dishes and plates (discus or
conchiclar) made of silver, bronze, pewter, and pottery, hoards of which
are frequently found. Knives and spoons of all shapes and sizes as well as
ladles and dippers (trullae and simpula) were made of bronze (often
leaded), iron, silver, wood, or bone. The lead scraped off and leached from
the dinnerware would have contributed to the dietary lead intake.
The adulteration of foods, particularly condiments, with lead, no doubt,
is as old as gourmet cooking and specialized food processing. Intentional
addition of lead to food items would have been rare, although the use of
lead compounds as a colorant for, and to add weight to spices is not incon 
ceivable (see Schmidt, 1924). The sweet taste that lead salts bring out in
organic acids was certainly familiar to the ancient peoples-particularly to
the Romans. Since the Romans did not have sugar, they extensively used
boiled-down grape juice (mustum curari) to impart sweet flavor to their
dishes. According to the degree of boiling down, the sweet syrup was
called sapa or defrutum or defritum, or sometimes by its Greek names
car(o)enum, hepsema, or siraeum (sireion). The definitions given in the
various classical texts do not always agree with each other. Demokritos
(extracts in the Geoponica 90.7.4) has told us that "some who upgrade
wine boil the must until 1/20 has evaporated. . . . The Lacedaemonians on
the other hand boil it until 1/5 has evaporated." According to Columella
(12.21) and Varro (1.60), defrutum is must reduced to one third of its vol 
ume by boiling, and Pliny (14.11) declared: "Siraeum, by some called hep 
sema and in our country sapa, is a product of art, not of nature, made by
boiling down must to a third of its quality; must boiled down to only one 
half is called defrutum." Palladius (11.18) furnished the following definitions:
Now about the prepartion of defrutum, caroenum, and sapa. Although all
three are made from the same substance, namely from must, the method of
their preparation modifies both their names and their properties. For defru 
tum has its name from "boiling down," and it is ready when it is reduced to
a thick consistency. Caroenum is ready when it has lost one-third of its vol 
ume with two-thirds remaining, sapa, when it has been reduced to one-third.
The latter is improved when quinces are cooked with it and fig wood is added
to the fire.
All the classicalauth~rsagree on one point, namely, that lead vessels are
to be preferred for boiling the must because they make the concentrate
sweeter and more durable. For must that should be boiled "lead and not
copper jars should be used," declared Pliny (14.27). Cato (On Agriculture,
art. 105) and Palladius (11.18) also recommended lead vessels. Columella
</p>
</div1>
<div1 id="page_14" n="14" type="page">
<p>334 Lead Exposure and Lead Poisoning
Nonoccupational Exposure 335
(12.20) explained his choice of lead vessels as follows: "The vessels them 
selves in which the thickened and boiled-down must is boiled should be of
lead rather than brass; for, in the boiling, brazen vessels throw off copper 
rust and spoil the flavor of the perservatives." Columella (12.19) recom 
mended gentle heating and constant stirring of the must-treatments that
would have exacerbated the leaching of lead from the vessels:
We shall carry from the vat to the boiling vessels as much as we require of
the must which has flowed from them before the pedicles of the grapes are
removed from the wine-press and we shall heat the furnace at first with a
gentle fire and with only very small pieces of wood, which the country peo 
ple call cremia (brushwood), so that the must may boil in a leisurely manner.
The man in charge of this boiling should have ready prepared strainers made
of rushes or broom, but the latter should be in a raw state, that is to say, not
beaten with a hammer. He should also have bundles of fennel attached to the
ends of sticks which he can let down right to the bottom of the vessels, so
that he can stir up any dregs which have settled at the bottom and bring them
up to the top; he should then clear away with the strainers any scum which
remains on the surface, and he should go on doing this until the must seems
cleared of all lees. Then he should add either some quinces, which he will
remove when they are thoroughly boiled, or any other suitable scents which
he likes, continuing nonetheless to stir the liquid from time to time with the
fennel to prevent anything from sinking to the bottom which might perforate
the leaden vessel. Next, when the vessel can stand a fiercer fire, that is,
when the must, being partly boiled away, is in a state of internal seething,
stems of trees and larger pieces of wood should be put underneath, without,
however, actually touching the bottom; for unless this contact is avoided, the
vessel itself will not infrequently be pierced, or, if this does not happen, the
must will certainly be burnt, and having acquired a bitter taste will be ren 
dered useless as a preservative.
There can be no doubt that the Roman sapa was highly contaminated with.
lead. Hofmann (1885) showed that freshly pressed Styrianrnust of white
grapes, when reduced in volume by 50%, acquired no less than 237 mg of
lead per liter of must from a lead sheet with a surface area of 348 em2
placed in the boiling liquid. Eisinger (1977) prepared sapa according to the
classical recipe, and he found that it indeed had a pleasing taste and aroma"
and that the lead content was about 1000 mg/liter. The two studies clearl y
suggest that one teaspoonful of sapa per day could cause chronic lead poi 
soning' and countless Romans would have consumed more than this dos-: 
age from their foods and drinks. Such a syrup also would have extracted
additional amounts of lead from lead-lined copper pots, pewter, and
leaded bronze vessels and utensils used in food preparation.
The Roman fondness for sweet and sour flavors is well known and the
cooks made common use of the cheap (in relation to honey and other an 
cient sweetners) sapa in their sauces and seasonings to assuage the appe 
tites of their patrons. Pliny (14.11) said that sapa was one of the cheap mix 
tures devised for adulterating honey. Out of the 450 or more recipes in
Apicius' cookbook (compiled in the fourth or fifth century A.D.),* roughly
20% (85 dishes) called for defrutum or caroenum. Examples of Apicius'
recipes featuring boiled-down must include: stuffed and chicken rissoles;
broth to be used as a laxative; marrows-as hors d'oeuvres, Alexandrian
fashion, and with fowl; seasoning of mallows, turnips, peas, beans, lentils,
mussels, and mushrooms; patinae of fish, fruit, and green vegetables; fri 
casse of fish or forcemeat; barley soup or broth; lentils with mussels;
sauces for all types of birds, such as crane, duck, chicken, and flamingo;
sauce for roasted, boiled, or sliced meats; truffles; sauce or seasoning for
boar, hare, venison, fried veal, and roast lamb; suckling pig cooked in a
metal casserole; as well as sauces and seasonings for all kinds of seafood 
crayfish and large prawns, squid, sea urchins, bonito, salt fish, grilled con 
ger eel, tunny fish, perch, murena, and scorpion fish (Apicius, The Art of
Cooking. 1-10).'It should come as no surprise that defrutum was featured
widely in ancient pastries (see Sayer, 1853). Curiously enough, sapa was
mixed with flour to fatten the snails reared by skillful speculators who re 
served them (the heavy ones!) for the Roman sybarites (Varro 3.14; Pliny
9.57).
The leaching of utensils used in preparing the sweetened dishes proba 
bly added more lead to the meals. A large majority (well over 50%) of
Apicius' recipes use wine, and thus this raises the possibility that such
dishes were also contaminated with lead from cooking vessels, or in the
wine.
Any lead in the water would have been transferred to the foodstuffs dur 
ing cooking. Recent studies using the radioactive tracer technique, in fact,
show that during cooking, vegetables and rice absorb up to 80 percent of
the water borne lead (Moore et al., 1979; Little et aI., 1981). The prepara 
tion of several ancient sauces such as passum (Columella 12:39) called for
soft and corrosive rainwater that had been boiled down, probably in lead
or lead-lined vessels. The lead intake by foodstuffs cooked in water from
1 the plumbing system would have contributed significantly to the dietary ex 
posure of the Roman population to that metal.
. One characteristic feature of Roman cooking was the pervasive use of
garum, or liquamen, which seems to have been a Greek invention of the
fourth century B.C. and which was later introduced to Rome (Brothwell
and Brothwell, 1969). This sauce was prepared not only at home but also
in large quantities in liquamen factories, some of which attained commer 
cial fame. Basically, it was made from salted-down entrails of fish from
*Whereas Apicius wrote his cookbook in the first century A.D., the book De Re
Coquinaria, as we now know it, was compiled toward the end of the fourth cen 
tury, or beginning of the fifth century A.D. (Flower and Rosenbaum, 1958). The
compiler probably added the various recipes for the average middle- and lower 
class households to Apicius' original recipes for the more luxurious table. The col 
lection of recipes from several sources gives us a picture of Roman eating through 
out a 300-400-year period.

<p>336 Lead Exposure and Lead Poisoning
Nonoccupational Exposure 337
which the liquor was strained and stored in jars. There were few Roman
dishes that were not improved with a dash of this sauce. Two eggs with a
dash of good garum made a simple and delicious meal (Martial 13.40). The
sauce was prepared in several ways (see Geoponica 20.46), including the
following, for a quick process:
If you wish to use the garum at once-i.e., not expose it to the sun, but boil
it-make it in the following manner: Take brine and test its strength by
throwing an egg into it to try if it floats; if it sinks the brine does not contain
enough salt. Put the fish into the brine in a new earthenware pot, add origan,
put it on a good fire until it boils-Le., until it begins to reduce. Some people
also add defrutum, Let it cool and strain it two and three times, until it is
clear. Seal and store away.
The contamination of liquamen with lead from the addition of defrutum is
significant. We cannot tell exactly what liquamen tasted like, but from the
recipe for its preparation, it must have been sharp and acidic, and thus was
corrosive to the leaden utensils. The basic liquamen was mixed with water,
wine, and vinegar, and it was then called hydrogarum, denogarum, oxy 
garum, and muria. Sometimes other spices and boiled-down must were
also added to the mixture. The conclusion thus seems inescapable that the
fish sauces, condiments, and wine preparations constituted a source of lead
contamination for a large number of Roman dishes.
Xenophon (Hieron 1.22) could not have been more perspective in his
condemnation of such foods: "How now?" said Hieron, "have you no 
ticed these many contraptions which are set before tyrants-acid, pungent,
astringent, and their brothers?" "Indeed I have," replied Simonides, "and
in my humble opinion they are very much opposed to man's nature." "Do
you not think," said Hieron, "that such viands are due to the appetites of
a soul debased and sick? For they who really like to, as you doubtless
know, require none of these fancy contraptions." By the fourth and fifth
centuries A.D., such entrees were dished up not only to the tyrants, but to
a large segment of the Roman population as well.
Then as now, apple, cherry, pear, plum, peach, quince, and other pre 
serves were made at home by heating or boiling down the appropriate in 
gredients; the use of pewter or lead-lined utensils would have insured the
contamination of such food items with lead. Furthermore, sapa was some 
times added as a sweetener or preservative. Often, the fruits were im 
mersed in a liquor (brine, vinegar, honey, rainwater, etc.) and then stored
in a vessel, presumably made of lead or one that was lead lined. Such man 
ifold contamination of fruits and vegetables is exemplified by the following
entries in Apicius' (1.12) cookbook:
To keep grapes fresh. Take undamaged grapes from the vine, and reduce
rain-water to one-third and put it in a receptacle in which you also put the
grapes. Treat the receptacle with pitch and seal with gypsum, and store it in
a cool place where the sun does not enter, and you will find fresh grapes
when required. The water can be given to the sick as honey-water.
To keep quinces fresh. Choose faultless quinces with their twigs and leaves,
and put them in a receptacle, and pour over honey and defrutum: you will
keep them for a long time.
To preserve blackberries. Make juice of blackberries, and mix with thick 
ened must (i.e., sapa), put in a glass vessel together with whole blackberries;
you will keep them for a long time.
To preserve turnips. First clean and arrange them in a vessel, and then pour
on myrtle-berries mixed with honey and vinegar.
Marcus Cato (ch. 7) also has the following to say about the preservation of
various farm products:
grapes are preserved in grape-pulp in jars; also they keep well in boiled wine,
or must, or after-wine. Plant or ingraft all kinds of fruit-sparrow-apples,
Scantian and Quirinian quinces, also other varieties for preserving, must 
apples and pomegranates; of pears, the volerna, the Anician frost-pears (these
are excellent when preserved in boiled wine), the Tarentine, the must-pear,
the gourd-pear, and as many other varieties as possible; of olives, the orcite
and posea, which are excellent when preserved green in brine or bruised in
mastic oil. When the orcites are black and dry, .powder them with salt for
five days; then shake off the salt, and spread them in the sun for two days,
or pack them in boiled must without salt. Preserve sorbs in boiled must; or
you may dry them; make them quite free from moisture. Preserve pears in
the same way.
The preceding suffices to suggest that foods- were one of the principal
sources of lead ingested, particularly by well-to-do Romans. Livy (39.6, 9)
tells us that, aside from being a chore which the cheapest slave could do,
cooking turned into an art during the second century B.C. As these "arti 
sans" became more and more sophisticated, they resorted increasingly to
lead-contaminated condiments to assuage the "sweet teeth" of their pa 
trons. The men who reportedly "lived for their palate alone" (Seneca De
beneficiis 1.10, 2) presumably died by their palates as well. The classical
satirists and moralists certainly handled the gourmand of their time without
mercy (e.g. Horace Satires 2.2; Lucan Nigr 31.72 ff.; Seneca De beneficiis
1.10.2; Epistles 47.1-8,89.22,90.7).
There is no literary evidence, however, to suggest an apprehension of
the dangers associated with lead contamination of the dishes. One is there 
fore surprised to find the following astute observation by Musonius (ca.
20-90 A.D.): "That masters are less strong, less healthy, less able to en 
dure labour than servants; countrymen more strong than those who are

bred in the city, those that feed meanly than those who feed daintily; and
that, generally, the latter live longer than the former. Nor are there any
other persons more troubled with gouts, dropsies, colics, and the like, than
those who, condemning simple diet, live upon prepared dainties." (Ex 
cerpt from Humelbergius Secundus, 1829) The published works of Muson 
ius are not now known to be extant (Charlesworth, 1936), and it is difficult
to establish whether the preceding remarks were his exact words. In a
sense, he does seem to be alone among the classical authors in associating
symptoms of lead poisoning with dainty food consumption.
Lead Contamination of Beverages
The contamination of fermented beverages with lead was fairly wide 
spread in ancient times, but it became rather prevalent in the Greco-Roman
world. Gilfillan (1965) listed 14 different ways in which the Romans con 
taminated their wine with lead. Only the major sources of lead contami 
nation of ancient drinks will be considered in this section.
Since the earliest times, drinking chiu (fermented beverages or "wine")
was a basic part of Chinese living, whether during the most sacred rituals
or in any casual moment of relaxation from work or worry (Schafer, 1977).
These beverages were at times served-and presumably stored-in lead or
highly leaded bronze flagons and cups (Chang, 1977; Linduff, 1977). In 
deed, a ranking official called Thang Tsun, who lived near the end of the
Early Han Dynasty, was accused of hypocrisy because he used earthen 
ware vessels for his food and drink (Chang, 1977, p. 79; Ying-shih Yu,
1977, p. 79). Similarly, some court officials with ministerial positions under
the reign of the emperor Kuang-wu (Han Dynasty, 206 B.c.-220 A.D.) were
berated for seeking to achieve reputations of frugality by using plain
wooden cups for eating and drinking (Yen, 1958, p. 536). The suggestion is
thus made that the aristocracy of ancient China was inclined to drink from
metallic cups. The habit certainly raises the question of chronic plumbism
among users of the lead and bronze wine containers.
Linduff (1977) has considered the problem of lead in the Late Shang and
Early Chou ritual vessels, and she has emphasized the fact that the wine 
drinking lead and bronze vessels were eliminated almost entirely from
Chou inventories at the end of the tenth century B.C. Linduff presented
some documentary evidence that alleges intemperance with respect to al 
coholic-beverage drinking in Shang China. She expressed the opinion that
"the downfall of the Shang was at least in part attributed to overindulgence
in drink. But the symptoms could have been due to lead present in even
small portions of liquid taken from bronze ritual vessels." Linduff, how 
ever, did make the valid point that the use of lead or bronze chueh and
chia receptacles for libation liquids or oblutions did not necessarily mean
that all the contaminated "wines" were actually consumed. A good meas-
ure of the liquids wouldhave been sprinkled or poured as offerings to the
ancestors (1977). Whether the Chou realized the dangers of drinking from
their lead or bronze vessels remains a vexing question; the elimination of
such ritualistic drinking vessels was probably aimed at curtailing excessive
drinking rather than at preventing plumbism.
The ancient Chinese were not the only people to use drinking vessels
tkylix, kantharos, kotyle, oinochoe, kyathos, etc.) made of lead alloys
(see chapter 4). Lead tumblers have been found in graves predating 3000
B.C. at Dr (Partington, 1935, p. 253), in prehistoric graves at al-'Dbaid
(Woolley, 1934), and in a cave at Trapeza, Crete, which dates to the Early
Minoan period (Branigan, 1968). From these very early examples, cups
and flagons made of lead and its alloys became progressively more abun 
dant, and by Roman times they were regularly used by the common freed 
men-while the aristocrats were accustomed to use gold or silver goblets.
Numerous finds of these vessels are known. It is germane also to mention
a very familar scriptural passage from. Matthew (26:27-28): "And He took
the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them saying, Drink ye all of it;
For this is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many
for the remission of sins." In the early Christian days, the "cup" that held
the wine would often have been made of lead or leaded bronze (Pulsifer,
1888), and only a few of the missionaries could afford the gold and silver
goblets. We can only speculate on the possible health risks posed by the
leaden vessels. It is of heuristic interest to note that Leonardo da Vinci's
The Last Supper surprisingly showed the dinner plates to be made of pew 
ter (Hamilton Spectator, Dec. 2, 1981, p. 33).
The ancient wine vases, casks, or jars (amphora, hydria, and krater)
were generally made of pottery, leather, or skin, and wood (Seltman, 1957;
Forbes, 1965). Occasionally, metal flogons and glass amphorae were used
domestically for special wines. Forbes (1965, p. 112) has noted the impor 
tant contribution of the wine trade to the development of Celtic art:
The typical wine-vessels or "amphorae" and bronze flagons with beaked
spouts are found in excavations in prehistoric Europe. They prove how wine
penetrated into central France by way of rivers Rhone and Saone and by
crossing the Belfort gap in the mountains reached the upper Rhine region.
Along with the wine went the drinking ritual and all the vessels connected
with carrying, storing, mixing and drinking it. These beautiful pottery or
bronze vessels had a profound influence on the art of the European barbari 
ans and a famous archaeologist has truly said that la Tene (Celtic) art may
have largely owed its existence to Celtic thirst.
Bronzes of the La Tene period tend to be notoriously high in lead (Chapter
4), and it would not have been propitious for anyone to drink the wines
stored in some of the flagons.
Lead was frequently used in antiquity for repairing the amphorae as well

as the pithoi, or dolia (wine vats). Numerous examples of pottery so
mended have come from Bronze Age sites in the Aegean and the Greek
mainland, from Hallstatt-culture sites of prehistoric Europe, and from
Roman-age sites, such as at Olynthus (see Chapter 4). Cato (art. 39) remarked
that rainy-day jobs on the farm included mending wine jars with lead. Also,
wooden casks used in storing wines were sometimes provided with lead
hoops. Additional contamination of the wine in amphorae could also have
come from the lead plugs used to "stopper" the vessels and from the red 
lead and white-lead pigments used in the proprietary labeling of the con 
tainers.
The ancient peoples paid close attention to whether the must was fer 
menting properly in the dolia. One of the tests for the so-called acetic fer 
mentation entailed square plates of lead, tin, and copper, measuring three
finger lengths in size, which were glued to the inner surface of the vat lid.
After the vat had remained sealed for 40 days and the plates were still
clean, then the wine was passed as good. Otherwise, a black, sour-tasting
bloom would be deposited on the tin plate, the copper plate would be cov 
ered with foul-smelling bubbles, and the lead plate would be turned "whit 
ish with scales resembling ceruse" (Geoponica 7.15; Hofmann, 1883).
Pliny (14.25) referred only to the lead-plate test rather superficially: "It is
a proof that wine is beginning to go bad if a sheet of lead when dipped in
it turns a different color." From such a test grew the habit-among some
vintners, at any rate-of having lead strips permanently in the wine vats as
a form of quality control. This practice continued well into the Middle Ages
with disastrous consequences (see Baker, 1767).
Lead glazes and enamels have been discussed in a preceding section
(see Chapter 4). In general, pottery and other artifacts garnished with lead
glazes were extensively used in Egypt and the Near East in the Ptolemaic
period (ca. 330-30 B.C.) and in China during the Han and possibly the Chou
periods. If the medieval glazes are any indication (see Grandjean, 1975),
the ancient glazed vessels must have given off large doses of lead if they
were used in storing or serving wines and other acidic beverages. We
know, for example, that salt meat stored in a lead-glazed bowl sometimes
takes the color and taste of lead chloride (Taylor, 1863, p. 433), and that
the Romans routinely boiled seawater and brine solutions (which they
added to their wines) in leaden vessels (Pliny 14.120; Cato 23.1-4; Colu 
mella 12.20-25). Lead contamination of wines and beverages stored or
served in lead-glazed vessels certainly would have been high enough to
cause plumbism among ancient consumers. A number of cases of both fatal
and nonfatal lead poisoning from this source have been reported in recent
years (Beritic and Stahedljak, 1961; Harris and Elsea, 1967; Lewin and
Lundin, 1968; Klien et al., 1970; Browder, 1972; DuFour et al., 1972; Wil 
liams, 1972). The contamination of wines from glazed pottery conceivably
was not widespread. Most of the ancient authors who dealt with wines rec 
ommended the coating of wine skins and wine jars with pitch in particular,
and with resins, wax, varnish, or oil (Pliny 14.24-25; Columella 12.18-19.
Indeed, Columella (12.19) tells us that "it will be well that those (boiling
vessels) which are made of lead should be coated inside with good oil and
be well rubbed, and that then the must should be put in. This prevents the
boiled-down must from being burnt."
Some contamination of ancient wines with lead may also be expected
from the cement used to seal the plugs or covers of the amphorae. "To
coat the brim of wine jars so as to give a good odor and keep any blemish
from the wine," Cato (art. 107) made the following recommendation: "Put
6 corgu of the best boiled must in a copper or lead vessel; take a hemina
of dried crushed iris and 5 pounds of fragrant Campanian melilot, grind
very fine with the iris, and pass through a sieve into the must. Boil the
whole over a slow fire of faggots, stirring constantly to prevent scorching;
continue the boiling, until you have boiled off half. When it has cooled,
pour into a sweet smelling jar covered with pitch, seal, and use for the
brims of wine jars." Pliny, (14.27) recommended basically the same toxic
sealant for wine vessels: "The jars must never be filled quite full, and the
space above the surface of the wine must be smeared with raisin-wine or
boiled-down must mixed with saffron or iris pounded up with boiled must.
The lids of the jars should be treated in the same way, with the addition of
mastich or Bruttian pitch."
Perhaps the most spectacular and probably the most damaging contam 
ination of ancient drinks with lead stemmed from the use of sapa, defru 
tum, etc., as sweetners, adulterants, or preservatives. A modern vinter
owes a deep though unromantic debt to sulfur. Wine barrels are sterilized
by having sulfur burnt inside them, and sulfur is used to control fermenta 
tion as well as to preserve the health of a wine once it is made. It imparts
no disagreeable flavor to the wine and, more importantly, it is harmless to
the enophic consumer (Younger, 1966). Sulfur as such was hardly ever
used in viticulture in ancient times, and in its stead boiled-down must was
widely used. Lead and its salts-dissolved in the acid that spoils wine 
give it a pleasant saccharine taste without any perceptible tint, and they
arrest the progress of the acid fermentation as well (Beckmann, 1846). In
the process, however, the wine is rendered quite toxic.
The contamination of grape juice (mustum curari) often began even as
the grapes were being pressed. Cato (art. 20) specified the use of lead in
the construction of the wine press: "The iron pivot which stands on the
post must stand straight upright in the centre; it should be fastened firmly
on all sides with willow wedges, and lead should be poured over it to pre 
vent it from shaking; if it moves, take it out and fasten again in the same
way, so that it will not move. Make the sockets for the stones of orcite
olive wood, and fasten them with lead, being careful to keep them tight.
Fix them on the axle."
In bad years when the must was of low grade, it became quite custom 
ary for the winegrowers in Greco-Roman times to boil the must down (to

increase its sugar content) before fermentation. The author of the Geopon 
iea (7.4) noted that "some who upgrade wine boil it until Yzo has evapo 
rated and then add VlO gypsum. The Lacedaemonians on the other hand
boil it until Vs has evaporated." People also attempted to improve the sugar
content of must from unripe grapes in the same manner. According to the
Geoponica (5.47), one estimates roughly how much must one can expect
the grape to yield, adds one third of this estimated volume in the form of
water, presses the grapes, and then reevaporates the juice to one third of
the volume. From what has been said about the preparation of sapa and
defrutum, there is little doubt that the concentration of must took place in
lead containers. At times, the fermentation was aided by simply spiking the
must with an older boiled-down must. Columella (12.20) recommended
either spiking or boiling down musts from wet vintages.
The must not used for making wines had to be preserved until consumed
or sold. Columella (20.19) tells us how this was done: "Some people put
the must in leaden vessels and by boiling reduce it by a quarter, others by
a third. There is no doubt that anyone who boiled it down to one-half
would be likely to make abetter, thick form of must and therefore more
profitable for use, so much so that it can actually be used, instead of must
boiled down to one-third, to preserve the must produced from old vine 
yards." The culinary uses of defrutum have already been discussed.
The principal difficulties confronting ancient winegrowers included the
acidity and instability of their wines, and Pliny (14.26) tells us that in his
time &#8226;'whole volumes of instructions on how to remedy these have been
published." To help their wine live until it was "old," the ancient peoples
sometimes used wine lees and such additives as pitch, resin, gypsum, tur 
pentine, chalk, marble dust, wood ashes, potash, crushed shells, fennel
seeds, sweet almonds, and burnt spruce shavings (see Beckmann, 1846,
and Hofmann, 1883, for excellent reviews). The statement by Demokritos
(Geoponiea 6.19) that the acidity of excessively sour wines was blunted
using minium (sandix) is disconcerting. The usual "aid" to indifferent
Greek and Roman wines, however, was boiled-down must (e.g., Geopon 
iea 7.13; Cato, art. 23; Pliny 14.25; Columella 12.21). Columella (12.21)
recommended year-old defrutum rather than fresh products because it had
by then already proved itself, whereas with even well-preserved freshly
boiled must, one could never tell whether or not it would turn sour and
thus spoil the wine it was supposed to aid:
Must of the sweetest possible flavour will be boiled down to a third of its
original volume and when boiled down, as I have said above, is called defru 
tum. When it is cooled down, it is transferred to vessels and put in store that
use may be made of it after a year. But it can also be added to wine nine
days after it has cooled; but it is better if it has remained undisturbed for a
year. A sextarius of this boiled-down must is added to two urnae of must if
the latter comes from vineyards in the hills; but if it comes from vineyards in
the plains, three heminae are added. When the must has been removed from
the vat, we allow it to cool off for two days and to become clear. On the
third day we add the boiled-down must; then, after an interval of two days,
when the must together with the boiled-down must has finished fermenting,
it is purified, and a heaped spoonful or a half-ounce measure generously filled
with roasted and pounded salt should be added to each two urnae of must.
In like manner, Cato (art. 23) recommends; "If necessary, add to the new
wine a fortieth part of must boiled down from untrod grapes.... When
you use boiled must or marble dust or resin, stir frequently for twenty days
and press down daily. "
Several ancient authors also talked of preserving must or wines using
boiled-down seawater or a boiled-down solution of common salt in rain 
water (Athenaeus 1.31; Dioscorides 5.27; Palladius 11.14; Pliny 14.25; Geo 
ponica 8.24,7.4). Columella (12.25) furnished the following details on how
to preserve must and wine with salt water:
Since some people-and indeed almost all the Greeks-preserve must with
salt or sea-water, I thought that part of the process ought not to be passed
over in silence. In an inland district, to which sea-water is not easily con 
veyed, brine for preserving purposes will have to be made as follows. Rain 
water is most suitable for this process, or, failing that, water flowing from a
very clear spring. Therefore you will take care to place as much as possible
of one or the other of these in the best vessels available for five years be 
forehand in the sun; then, when it has putrefied, you must leave it alone till
it has returned to its former condition. When it has done so, you must have
other vessels ready; and gradually strain the water into them, until you reach
the dregs; for some sediment is always found in water which has been al 
lowed to stand. When the water has been thus treated, it must be boiled
down to a third of its original volume, in the same way as must which is
boiled down. Then a sextarius of white salt and a sextarius of the best honey
are added to fifty sextarii of fresh water, which must be likewise boiled down
and all impurities removed. Then, when the mixture has cooled down, what 
ever liquid there is, that amount must be added to an amphora of must.
If, however, your property is near the sea, water should be taken from the
open sea when the winds are silent and the sea is as quiet as possible, and
should be boiled down to a third of its original volume, some of the spices
detailed above having been added, if it shall be thought fit, so that the wine
may have more flavour after it has been treated.
Columella (12.21) also tells us that his paternal uncle of the same name, an
&#8226;'illustrious agricola," employed (and presumably devised) such a preser 
vation technique. In order not to oversalt the wines, he (12.21) counsels
any careful proprietor interested in wine making to try three or four sam 
ples of his very first vintage with varying amounts of preservatives in order
to ascertain just how much brine the wine can stand without its taste being
harmed.
The point that should be emphasized here is that lead forms highly sol 
uble complexes with the chloride ions (Nriagu, 1971). Thus, boiling a brine
</p>
</div1>
<div1 id="page_19" n="19" type="page">
<p>344 Lead Exposure and Lead Poisoning Nonoccupational Exposure 345
solution in a leaden vessel would certainly result in high-level contamina 
tion of the liquor with lead. The preservative action of the "treated" brine
solutions most likely can be attributed to the lead acquired from the boiling
vessels. An analogy can be drawn here with the observations by Celsus
(2.30) and Pliny that raw honey was a good dietary laxative, but that when
boiled it was turned into a constipating agent. The only way the effect
could be reversed simply by boiling is to presume that enough lead was
leached out of the boiling kettles to serve as the antidiarrheal agent (Ko 
bert, 1909).
The Greek admiration for oinos thalassikos (salted or seawater wine) is
well known. "Wine is sweet when seawater is poured into it," says Ath 
enaeus (l.26b). The salting of ancient wines is thus subject to a double
interpretation. In the first place, it was used to preserve the life of the
wine, and in the second place, it was used either to give "bite" or pi 
quancy to the wine, or to disguise a deficient wine. The latter motive is of
little concern here.
Dryness in ancient wines was not always a desirable quality (Younger,
1966, p. 146). According to Athenaeus (1.30b-c, 32c-d), "the Athenians
liked not the hard stiff poets any more than they liked Pramnian wines,
which contract the eyebrows as well as the bowels; rather they want wines
with delicate bouquet and nectar-distilling ripeness ... for sweet wine is
the most nutritious; it smooths the tract through which it passes and by
thickening the humors more, tends to incommode the head less." Although
a degree of sweetness of the ancient drinks was obtained by blending (Ath 
enaeus 1.32a-b), a common and widely used process involved boiling the
wine down in lead kettles until it became sweet, or else "doctoring" the
wine with boiled-down must. To make sharp wine mild and sweet, Cato
(art. 109) advised: "Make 4 pounds of flour from vetch, and mix 4 cyathi
of wine with boiled must; make into small bricks and let them soak for a
night and a day; then dissolve with wine in the jar, and seal sixty days
later. The wine will be mild and sweet, of good colour and of good odour."
On the other hand, Pliny (14.24) suggested a less complicated method: "In
some places they boil the must down into what is called sapa and pour this
into their wines to overcome their harshness." Columella's (12.20) detailed
prescriptions will be given later.
Ancient literary sources leave us with a compelling impression that a
large number of Greek and Roman wines were hopelessly "fiddled." Ath 
enaeus (1.32c) remarked slyly that it "was a true saying, that wine must
have not only its portion of water but also a bit of a jest." The popularity
of wine adulteration is better exemplified in the following indignant pas 
sages from Pliny: "We know that for the sake of colouring the wine, col 
ours are added as a sort of pigment and that this gives the wine more body.
So many poisons are employed to force wine to suit our taste-and we are
surprised that it is not wholesome" (Pliny 14.25). And then in a sweeping
condemnation, Pliny says: "Today indeed not even our nobility ever en-
joys wines that are genuine. So low has our commercial honesty sunk that
only the names of the vintages are sold, the wines being adulterated as
soon as they are poured into the vats" (Pliny 23.20). Also, equally note 
worthy is the following (Pliny 14.8): "And about the rest of the wines
grown in the Province of Narbonne (Gaul south of Lyon), no positive state 
ment can be made inasmuch as the dealers have set up a regular factory
for the purpose and color them by means of smoke, and I regret to say also
employing noxious herbs and drugs...." It is not outside the realm of
possibility that the noxious drugs included lead salts (Baker, 1767, p. 261).
It serves no purpose to describe here the wide assortment of additives
used by the ancient peoples to give their wine a most peculiar flavor and
fragrance or to enhance its bouquet (see Hofmann, 1883, for example). The
practice relevant to this discussion is the general concoction of essences
from defrutum and herbs, pitch, odoramenta, and berries. Columella
(12.20) provides a detailed description of the ancient art of "condire"-the
doctoring of wines with herbs and sweetening ingredients-in his case,
boiled-down must:
The odours boiled with the must which are generally speaking suitable for
wine are iris, fenugreek and sweet rush; a pound of each of them ought to be
put in the boiling-cauldron, which has received ninety amphorae of must,
when it has just gone off the boil and has been cleared of scum, Then if the
must is naturally thin, when it has been boiled down to a third of its original
quantity, the fire must be removed from below it and the furnace immediately
cooled with water: even if we have done this, the boiled-down must never 
theless sinks to a level lower than the third of the vessel. But, although this
is some disadvantage, it is nevertheless beneficial; for the more the must is
boiled-down,-provided it be not burnt-the better and the thicker it be 
comes. Of this boiled-down must, when it has been thus treated, it is enough
if one sextarius is mixed with one amphora of wine. When you have boiled
ninety amphorae of must in the boiling cauldron to such an extent that only
a little of the whole remains (which means that it has been boiled-down to a
third), then and not before, add the preservatives which are either liquid or
resinous, namely ten sextarii of liquid N emeturican pitch, after you have
carefully washed it with boiled seawater, and also a pound and a half of tur 
pentine resin. When you will add these things, you will stir the leaden vessel
thoroughly, so that they may not be burnt. Then when the boiling liquid has
sunk to a third of its original quantity, withdraw the fire and stir the leaden
vessel from time to time, so that the boiled-down must and the preservatives
may mingle together. Then when the boiled-down must seems to be moder 
ately hot, you will gradually sprinkle into it the rest of the spices after they
have been bruised and sifted, and you will give orders that what you have
boiled down is to be stirred with a wooden ladle until it begins to cool. If you
do not mix them as we have directed, the spices will sink to the bottom and
be burnt. To the aforesaid quantity of must the following spices ought to be
added: the leaf of spikenard, the illyrian sword-lily, the Gallic spikenard, the
costus, the date, the angular rush and the sweet-rush, of everyone of which

half-a-pound will. suffice; also a quincunx of myrrh, a pound of sweet reed,
half-a-pound of cmnarnon, a quadrans of balsam, a quincunx of saffron, and
a pound of vine-leafed cripa. These, as I have said, ought to be added after
having been pounded when dry and sifted, and rasis, a kind of crude pitch
should be mixed with them, which is considered to be better the older it is'
for in the course of time it grows harder and, when it is pounded, it is re 
duced to powder and mixes with these preservatives. But it is enough for six
pounds ofit to be mixed with the quantities already mentioned. It's uncertain
how much of this preparation ought to be added to forty-eight sextarii of
~ust,beca~sethe calculation of the right amount must be based on the qual 
ity of the wine. I personally, if the vintage is wet, usually mix a triens of the
prese,:vative in two amphorae; if it is dry, a quadrans, so that the quantity of
must IS four urnae, an urna being twenty-four sextarii. I am aware that some
husbandmen have put a quadrans of the preservative in each amphora but
that they were obliged to do so owing to the excessive weakness of the~ine
which scarcely kept sound for thirty days. '
Columella (12.20) ended his instructions with the injunction to the perpe 
trator to make sure "that the flavour of the adulterants is not noticeable
for that drives away the purchaser." '
. Anindic~mentof~hese.Greek and Roman confusum (mixed or blended)
WInes as highly tOXIC poisons comes from the experiment by Hofmann
(1883). Following the instructions of Columella (12.11), to each of two urns
(26.6.L) ofm~s~of grapes from (1) mountain vineyards, (2) field vines, and
(3) slightly acidified must, he added roughly Y6 congius (0.55 L), 3 heminae
(0.82 L), and as much as 2 sextarii (1.1 L) of defrutum, respectively. He also
added 13.6 g of table salt, an equal amount of gypsum, and roughly 11 cc
of the powder oifoenum Graecum. He found that in the process each liter
of the mountain wine acquired 15 mg of lead, while the lead concentrations
in the valley wine and poorest must were about 22 and 30 mg/l
respectively. '
Kobert's (1909) valiant attempt-to confirm that the Roman wines were
highly .contaminated with lead by actually measuring the lead contents of
desiccated wine residues in the ampullae from the catacombs or the am 
phorae from Pompeii, Herculanum, and elsewhere-never materialized.
Such a study may stilI yield interesting results.
Boiled-down must was also widely used in the effort to imitate certain
pop~larbran~sof ancient wines. The recipe containing defrutum is given,
for Instance, In the Geoponica (8.22), for imitating the Aminaean wine that
w~svalued for its delicate bouquet. Cato (art. 24) recommends that "if you
w~shto make ast~a~-coloredwin.e, take equal parts of yellow and Apician
WIne and add a thirtieth of old boiled wine. Add a thirtieth of concentrated
must to any kind of blended wine. "
In tern:
s
of leadcontami~ation,the least radical adulteration procedure
was the Improvement of WInes by blending together two or more wine
brands (Martial 1.18; Athenaeus 1.326; Pliny 14.9; Palladius 11.14; Prov-
erbs 33.29-30; Talmud-B, Pesahim, 456; etc.). Another way of giving new
wine the appearance of the old consisted in triturating fragments of earthen
vessels in which quality old wines had been stored with the lees of old
wine. Damogeron claimed that when a modius (about 4.4 liters) of this mix 
ture was added to one amphora of fresh new wine and left standing for two
weeks in sealed vessels, you would think that the wine was 10 years old
(Geoponica 7.24).
There was also the habit of mulling wines, usually in leaden vessels, be 
fore they were served during the cold season (Galen 7.6; Athenaeus 1.31d).
In his Satires (art. 5, line 145), Persius mocked a spendthrift: "You take
your dinner on a bench while a dumpy pot exhales for you the fumes of
some reddish Veientine wine that has been spoilt." Archaeological finds
actually confirm such a practice. About 120 bars and restaurant bars have
been identified in Pompeii, and nearly every block of houses excavated has
its own bar, in much the same way that cafes are located in modern con 
tinental cities (Younger, 1965). One of the distinctive types of bars found
at Pompeii and also at Herculaneum was the thermopolium, which featured
mulled hot drinks. Excavations of such a tavern in Pompeii have yielded a
lead kettle enclosed in a stove, provided with an outlet pipe leading into
the alley premises, and presumably used to heat mulled wine and some
other drinks tGmelins, 1973). Gilfillan (1965) believed that since the houses
were almost unheated, there must have been many cold days when mulled
wines were in demand. Very often though, the Greeks, in particular, and
the Romans also mixed their wines with water (Seneca Epist, 73; Martial
6.86; Hippocrates Aphorisms 16.5; Athenaeus 2.36a-c; Aristophanes The
Frogs 211). The mixing bowl or cauldron, which was at times warmed over
a charcoal brazier (Athenaeus 2.37-39), typically was made of leaded
bronze, leaded brass, or pewter.
In addition to table wines, there were also afterwines ivinum faeca 
tum), which Pliny (14.11) does not even include among the wines; the
"artificial" (herbal, aromatic, and medicinal) wines; and the sweet (dulcia
or bel/aria) wines, including those that contained honey. Pliny (14.29) es 
timates that there were at least 185 kinds of beverages in his time, and
even double that number if one included the varieties. A number of these
beverages apparently were contaminated with lead simply because they
contained the tainted boiled-down must, or else their preparation called for
boiling down, presumably in a leaden kettle. The following are represent 
ative of common Greek and Roman drinks that are believed to have been
severely contaminated with lead:
1. "Decocta," "karynon," "yayin mebushal," Ifadynamon." These
drinks contained grape juice or must boiled down to the required consis 
tency (Dioscorides 5.13; Mishnah 2.6; Talmud-B, p. 525; Pliny 14.12,
14.19). "Thereupon Cynulcus asked for a drink of decocta saying that he
</p>
</div1>
<div1 id="page_21" n="21" type="page">
<p>needed to wash away salty words with fountains of sweetness" (Athenaeus
3.12lf.).
2. "Oxmel," or sour-honey. A mixture of honey, vinegar, sea salt,
and rainwater boiled 10 times (Pliny 14.20; Dioscorides 5.22). If lead ves 
sels were used, the lead concentration would have increased with each
heating, and the final product would have been a deadly poison.
3. "Aqua mulsa," "melicrat," or "hydromel." A blend of honey
with rainwater boiled down to a third of its original volume (Pliny 14.20;
Geoponica 8.28; Columella 12.12). It acted as an antidiarrheal agent (Pliny
14.20).
4. "Thalassomeli." A mixture of equal parts of brine, fresh honey,
and rainwater and evaporated in a lead kettle until it acquired the consis 
tency of defrutum and used in the same way as mella, or aqua mulsa, and
defrutum (Columella 12.11; Pliny 31.36).
5. Fruit syrup. Columella (12.42) furnished the following instructions:
The preparation of a remedy against colic called "fruit-syrup" is made as fol 
lows. An urna of must made from Aminean grapes grown on trees is boiled
in a new earthenware or lead cooking-pot with twenty large quinces which
have been well cleaned and are sound, sweet pomegranates, which are called
Carthaginian apples, and service apples which are not very soft and have
been split and had their seeds removed, a quantity weighing about three sex 
tarii. These are boiled so that all the fruit dissolves in the must, and there
should be a boy to stir the fruit with a wooden slice or a reed, so that it can 
not burn. Then when they have been boiled down so that not much juice re 
mains, they are allowed to cool and are strained, and what is left at the bot 
tom of the strainer is carefully crushed and pulverized and then boiled again
a second time in its own juice upon a slow charcoal fire, so that it may not
burn, until a thick sediment, resembling lees, is formed. But before the prep 
aration is removed from the fire, three heminae of Syrian rosemary, crushed
and sifted, are added on the top of all and mixed in with a spatula, so that it
may unite with the other ingredients.
6. "Myrtites," "mursinites," or myrtle wine. Basically a mixture of
the juice of myrtle berries and honey that was thickened by boiling (Cato,
art. 125; Columella 12.38; Pliny 15.37, 14.19; Palladius 2.18, 3.27; Dioscor 
ides 5.37). To this group may be assigned kydonites or melites-a mixture
of quince juice, honey, and vinegar, which was boiled (in a lead vessel
probably) until it acquired the consistency of honey (Palladius 11.20; Geo 
ponica 8.27; Dioscorides 5.28).
7. Herb wines and wines from shrubs. The preparation of sapa-like
concentrates to be used in the adulteration of wines has been described
previously (from Columella 12.20). Such concentrates often were used also
in the preparation of the herb or shrub wines. In addition, we find several
other instructions, such as: "Among the plants grown in gardens, wine is
made from the root of asparagus, and from cunila, wildmarjoram, parsley-
seed, southern-wood, wild mint, rue, catmint, wild thymeand. horeh?und;
they put two handfuls of herb into a jar of must,togethe~WIth a pint of
boiled-down grape-juice and half a pint of sea-water" (Plmy 14.19; Geo 
ponica 8.2-15; Dioscorides 5.64). "The following is the way to make up
wines flavoured with wormwood, hyssop, southern-wood, thymefe~nel

other things mentioned above. Three pounds of dry fleabane m a congius
of must is removed, can be added to an urna of must" (Columella .12.35;
Pliny 14.19). These beverages were initially used solely for therapeutic pur 
poses but gradually became adopted as the drinks for women.
8. "Circumsicium," or "circumcidaneum" (afterwines) for the field
hands. "Pour into a jar 10 quadrantals of must, 2 quadrantals of sharp
vinegar, 2 quadrantals of boiled must, 50 quadrantals of fresh water..~tlr
with a stick thrice a day for five consecutive days. The.na~d64 .sextanl of
old sea-water, cover the jar, and seal ten days later. ThIS wine~ll1l~styou
until the summer solstice; whatever is left over after the solstice will be a
very sharp and excellent vinegar" (Cato, art. 104;Colume~l~12.40).
9. "Spiced-wine surprise." It is made as follows (ApiClUS 1.1):
15 lb. of honey are put in a metal vessel into which you~avepreviouslyp~t
2 pints of wine, so as to boil down the wine whileco~kmg.theh~ney.It IS
heated over a slow fire of dry wood, stirring all the while WIth a stick; when
it begins to boil over it is checked by adding [cold] wine; it~lsosinks when
removed from the fire. When cool it is heated once more. ThIS must be done
a second and third time, and only then is it removed from the fire, and
skimmed on the following day. Then take 4 oz. pepper, 3 scruples of
pounded mastic, a handful each ofaro~aticle~fand saffron, 5 roa.sted.date 
stones, the dates softened in wine, havmg previously been soaked mwm~of
the right kind and quality, so as to produce a soft mash. Thesepr~p~r~tlons
completed, pour over 18 pints of sweet wine. In the end add coals, if It IS too
bitter.
In spite of the widespread use of preservatives andth~widespr~adadul 
teration and aromatization of wines, the Roman connoisseurs still appre 
ciated a pure wine. Columella (12.19) firmly states:"~eregard as the best
wine any kind which can keep without any preservative, nor should any 
thing at all be mixed with it by which its natural savour woul.d be obscured;
for that wine is most excellent which has given pleasure.by Its .own natural
quality." There is, however, no doubt that by the Empire period, the pal 
ate of the upper-class Romans had become habituated to theco~f~sedand
adulterated wines. The confusion in taste could~aveb~enCo~dItIonedby
the Roman fondness for pungency and richness III their .cookmg. Juvenal
(Satires, 11) satirizes, in this regard:"B~tno~adaysa nch man tak.es no

guents and his roses seem to smell rotten." Their widespread use of sapa
and defrutum to disguise the imperfections of their wine and to satiate their
"sweet tooth" must be regarded as a fatal mistake. Seutonius (The Twelve
Caesars 3.34) perceptively attributed the decline of the Roman Empire to
apathy and gluttony, and modern research suggests that this may have
been true in a rather different sense.
It is most remarkable that the ancient literary sources are completely
silent on the possible adverse health effects of lead in the boiled-down
must and brine solutions. The evil effects of wines were often ascribed to
other adulterants in the wine, but rarely to the lead. Pliny (23.24), for in 
stance, declares: "As for wines treated with marble, gypsum or lime, who
would not dread to touch them, however robust his health?" Martial
(10.36) presumed that the smoke in the wine was the deadly toxin:
Whatever Massilia's vile smoke-rooms, whatever jar acquires its age from
the fire, comes from you Munna; to your wretched friends you consign over
the sea, over long roads, deadly poison, and not at an easy price, but at one
which would satisfy a crock of Falernian or Setine, dear to its own cellars.
Why you do not. come to Rome after such an interval, this is, I think, your
reason: you shun drinking your own wines.
Dioscorides (5.9, 19) notes that "wine adulterated with brine [and loaded
with lead presumably] is bad for the stomach, induces thirst, is bad for the
nerves, induces diarrhoea, and is not beneficial to those recovering from
illness." On the other hand, he noted (5.9) that''wine adulterated with gyp 
sum is injurious to the nerves, induces headaches and fever and is bad for
the bladder. ... The addition of sapa and defrutum to wines may cause
headaches, intoxication and stomach trouble." Continuous drinking of the
doctored wines, Dioscorides (5.11) further notes, is pernicious, ruins the
nerves, and causes melancholia. Clearly, such maladies are more likely to
stem from the lead than from the presumed adulterant in the wine.
Athenaeus (l.33b) notes that the Zacynthian and Leucadian wines, on
account of the admixture of gypsum, are injurious to the brain. When the
fine Alban and Falerian wines were aged for a long time, they acted like
drugs and soon caused stupor (Athenaeus 1.33a; Dioscorides, art. 11).
"Those who drink toasts too constantly come to have an un-natural con 
dition of the stomach" (Athenaeus 1.45d). The drinkers of the Troezenian
wine are reputed to have been rendered childless (Theophrastus History of
Plants 9.18; Pliny 14.22; Athenaeus 1.31f.), while the Egyptian "delivery
wine" caused abortion (Pliny 14.22). Dioscorides (5.10) presented the fol 
lowing long list of wines that cause constipation and hurt the nerves:
But that ye wines in Italy, which seems to excel, is called Falernurn, which
being old is soon digested, recalling the Pulse, binding ye belly, and good for
ye stomach, but bad for ye bladder, and unfitting for ye dull-sighted and for
to be much drunk of. But ye Albanian is of thicker parts than ye Falernian,
sweetish, puffing of the stomach, mollifying the belly, and not working alike
upon ye digestion, but less hurting of ye sinewy part, and this also when it is
old grows hard. Ye Caecubum being sweet, is of thicker parts than ye Alba 
nian, and a breeder of flesh, and of a good colour, but bad for digestion. But
Surrentinum is very hard, wherefore. it stays ye flux of ye entrailes, and of
ye stomach, and it toucheth ye head less, being of light parts, but when old
it is good for ye stomach, and becomes more pleasant. Ye Adrianum and ye
Mamertianum growing in Sicily are both alike of thick parts indifferently
binding, and they grow old quickly, and they touch ye sinewy part less be 
cause of mildness that is in them. And ye Praepianum, which is brought out
of ye places about Adria, is of a sweet scent and milder, but being much
drank of, it lies not hid, but keeps drunkenness for a long time, and brings a
sleep. That which is called Istricum is like to ye Praepianum, being more
ureticall. But ye Chium is more gentle than ye aforesaid, well-nourishing, po 
table, less making drunk, staying a flux, useful to be put in eye medicines.
But ye Lesbian is easily digested, being lighter than ye Chian, and good for
ye belly. But that which grows by Ephesus, and is called Phygelites doth ob 
tain the same virtue to this, but that of Asia called Messogites from ye moun 
tain Timotus breeds ye headache and hurts ye sinews. But ye Coon, and
Clazomenian because they partake of much sea-water, are soon corrupted,
are inflative, are disturbers of ye belly, and hurters of ye sinews.
The controversial epigram by Martial (6.78) should be noted here. It says:
"Phryx, a notorious tippler, was blind, Aulus, of one eye,a~d?lea~-eyed
in the other. Heras, his doctor, said to him: 'Beware of drinking; If you
drink wine you will not see at all.' Phryx laughed, and said to his eye
'Adieu.' Immediately he orders eleven measures to be mixed for him, and
frequently. Do you ask for the result? Phryx drank a vintage, his eye
venom" Rutherfurd (1934), an opthalmologist, saw in the epigram a case
of lead poisoning with optic neuritis, and he reasoned that the toxin was
more likely to be lead than methyl alcohol. Oppenheimer (1928), however,
diagnosed Phryx's problem as "alcohol eye disease," while Crawfor?
(1913) concluded that it was a case of albuminuric retinitis (or uremic reti 
nopathy). Stevenson (1949) also disagreed with Rutherfurd's diagnosis,b~t
he offered no opinion as to the cause of Phryx's disease. Dr. F. J. Coodin
(personal communication, 1982) notes that the scanty clinical picture given
by Martial could fit with chronic alcoholism (and secondary vitamin-B 1 de 
ficiency), with the ingestion of wood alcohol, or with plumbism, but it may
as easily, or even more readily, characterize many other eye diseases".
Both Celsus (2.30) and Dioscorides observed that defrutum and boiled
rnulsurn are constipating. Pliny (23.30) pointed out the ecbolic property of
sapa: "Taken with onions, it has an abortive effect, and can be used to
bring out dead foetus and the afterbirth." Kolbert (1909) maintains that the
onion was not guilty of such an effect, and that the lead in the sapa was
the abortifacient. The use of preparations entailing boiled wine, must, or
honey as contraceptives and abortifacients has been recommended by

Pliny (28.30, 24.37; 25.37), Soranus (19.62-63), Oribasios (1.116), and
Aetios of Amida (16.16-17). If lead kettles were used as was generally the
case, enough lead could presumably be leached out to constitute the active
ingredient.
All the maladies just described, which were acquired from drinking an 
cient wines or wine preparations, might just as well have been symptoms
of lead poisoning. Although a number of the cited authors alluded to the
appropriate syndromes, they failed to link such symptoms to the lead in
the wine. Gypsum, lime, marble, salt, and the other additives seem to have
served as the red herring that diverted their attention from the true toxin
in their beverages. Indeed, Pliny's (14.25) animadversion on the many poi 
sons in wines may be true, but for a reason that he did not suspect.
Saturnine Drugs and Elixirs
Lead and its compounds were among the first drugs of mineral origin to be
used by mankind. In fact, they have been used medicinally from the earli 
est times (probably from the Stone Age) and by the rudest tribes. As noted
already, galena-the most common ore of lead-was used as an eye salve
in pre-Dynastic Egypt. The most ancient evidence of such application dates
from the Badarian period about 6000 years ago. There is evidence that gal 
ena was used as an eye makeup and salve in the ancient Indian civilization
of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa, whose golden ages lasted from 3200-2800
B.C. Such an application for galena is also recorded in the Old Testament
and in the inscriptions from the ancient Mesopotamian cultures. It is not
clear whether the galena found in ancient graves of the North American
Indians had any prophylactic significance (Farquhar and Fletcher, 1980).
The traditional medicine of most West African cultures includes galena as
an eye salve-a practice that probably dates back to antiquity.
The use of other lead compounds-particularly the oxides in materia
medica also preceded recorded history. The prescriptions of the ancient
Babylonian medical tablets employed lead compounds in plasters, although
there are still philological problems in identifying the lead salts used. The
pharmacopoeia of ancient Egypt preserved in the Papyrus Ebers (Bryan,
1930) and the Hearst Medical Papyrus (Leake, 1952) featured lead com 
pounds, particularly in astringents, external cooling agents, and collyria.
Hindu prescriptions containing lead (sfsa) and red lead (Sindiira) can also
be found in the old Sanskrit medical compendia, such as the Charaka Sa 
mahita, Susrata, and Vagbahata (Sharma, 1972; Jaggi, 1973; Mitra, 1974;
Zimmer, 1948). The ancient Chinese literary references to the lead elixir
will be considered later.
At this point, the important difference in the therapeutic applications of
lead in the "old west" and the "old east" should be noted. With few ex 
ceptions, lead salts were prescribed primarily for external remedies and for
diseases of women in the West. By contrast, ancient Chinese texts contain
numerous recipes for saturnine elixirs that were consumed to attain im 
mortality or longevity. The first part of this section will focus on saturnine
drugs of the "old west," while the second part will address the staurnine
elixirs.
Metallic lead was widely assigned chthonic properties, and as such it
played an important role in ancient magicosacerdotalhea~ing.Lead plates
inscribed with invocations, abjurations, and prayers to reinforce the cura 
tive effects of remedies or simply to drive off the demonic paroxym have
been found dating to prehistoric times. Lead amulets, talismans, pendants,
and medallions were worn to protect health. Some interesting sidelights on
lead in the medicine of folklore were given in Chapter 1. ,
Pliny (34.50) succinctly summarized the medicinal uses of metallic lead
in ancient times: "In medicine lead is used by itself to remove scars, and
leaden plates are applied to the region of the loins and kidneys. for their
comparative chilly nature to check the attacks of.v~nerealpassions, and
the libidinous dreams that cause spontaneous ermssions to the extent of
constituting a kind of disease. It is recorded that the pleader Calvus used
these plates to control himself and to preserve his bodily strength for la 
borious study. Nero, whom heaven was pleased to make emperor, used to
have a plate of lead on his chest when singing songsfo.rtissim~,thus show 
ing a method for preserving the voice." Because of Its coohng property,
Soranus (Gynaecology 2.41) recommends applying a piece ofle~d.to the
navel of a newborn child after the umbilical cord has been shed-It IS sup 
posed to help the wound cicatrize and the umb.ilicus mold properly~ntoa
cavity. The Galenists usually compounded their lead drugs, accordmg~o
their qualitative composition or homoeopathy: hot, cold, wet, and dry, in
varying degrees (Multhauf, 1966, p. 216). Dioscordies (5.95) recommends
using the lead "unmixed" from washed lead as a rub to help the str?ke of
the sea scorpion or the dragon! Several ancient authors, such as Diocles,
Serapion, Erasistratus (all cited by~ureliusAc~teDis~ases.3.160, 169),
and Alexander of Trailles (9.1) prescnbed lead pills for intestinal obstruc 
tion. Because of its weight, the lead pill is supposed to dislodge and drive
out the obstructing matter.
Galen (vol. 12, p. 231) also recommends a lead plate for noctural emis-
sions. On this matter, Aurelius (Chronic Diseases 5.84) flatly states: "Pro 
vide the patient with a hard, cold bed, and have him lie on his side when
he goes to sleep.... Place a long, thin lead plate under his loins or put
sponges soaked in cold vinegar water around them:" Lewin(l~20)has
even suggested that lead plates were used by the ancient peoples in an ef-
fort to produce sterility or at least to prevent conception. .
For the treatment of ganglion, Oribasius (De virt, simpl, 2, Cited by
Adams, 1844) and Paulus Aegineta (4.26) apply "a thick plate of. lead~ike
the vertibrae, and larger than the ganglion, and bind it 'on, for by Its weight
this dissolves it in due time." Aetios (15.9) recommends nearly the same
plan of treatment: "Bind a piece of lead upon the tumor, and after some

days remove it when ganglion will be found much softened; it is then to be
squeezed.firmly between the thumb and the fingers by which mean it '11
be speedily dissolved." Topre~entsuppuration, a special set 0;~r:~s
calledenh~meswere used, especially on flesh wounds (Majno, 1975). One
example-:-lll the~ormof dry powder-contained metallic lead powered to 
gether with spodium from Cyprus, silver dross, copper scales, chalcitis,
and alum (HIppocrates On Wounds 2). Several ancient prescriptions called
for"w~shedlead," which has been presumed to be a basic lead hydrox'd
(see Plmy 34.50; Dioscorides 5.95). 1 e
L~ad.sUI~de(galena, plumbum combustum, or plumbum elotum) found

.~0- ippocrattc texts, attnbuted to the school of Knidos used it
III :molhents foruI~ers(Partington, 1970, p. 33). Pliny (33.34)a~dDios 
condes (5.100) furnish a good detail of its medicinal applications: "It is
used to make an~ye-washand for women's skins to remove ugly scars and
spots and as a hair wash. Its effect is to dry to soften to cool to a t
gentle u t fill ' . '" c as a
. p rge,~u~ca~ltiescaused by ulcers, and to soften tumours; it
ISus~das anmgredle~tIII plasters serving these purposes, and for the
emol.hent plastersmentI~nedabove. Mixed with rue and myrtle and vine 
gar, It also removes erysipelas, and likewise chilblains if mixed with myrtle
and wax."
~liny(33.34) then presents an account-at times confused-on how to
punfy the galena and prepare the kohl (which typically contained black
carbon and lead, or antimony):
It is prepared by being smeared round with lumps of ox dung and burnt .
ovens, and th.en cooled down with women's milk and mixed with rainwater
and pounded I?mort~rs.And next the turbid part is poured off into a copper
vessel after being punfied with soda. The less are recognized by being full of
lead, andt~eysett~eto the bottom of the mortars and are thrown away, Then
the vessel mto ,:hICh the turbid part was poured off is covered with a cloth
and left for a night,an~the next day anything floating on the surface is
poured off 0: removedWIt~a sponge. The sediment on the bottom is consid 
ered the choicest part and IS covered with a linen cloth and put to dry in the
sun but notallo~e,dto ?ecome very dry, and is ground up a second time in
the mortar and divided~ntos~alltablets, But it is above all essential to limit
the amount of heat applied to It, so that it may not be turned into lead. Some
peo~le,do not employ dung in boiling it, but fat. Others pound it in water and
strain It through three thicknesses of linen cloth and throwaway the d
and pour offt~eliquor that con:esth~ough,collecting all the deposita~e~s~
bottom, and this they use as an mgredient in plasters and eye-washes.
There is no record to show that the Greco-Roman physicians used lead sul 
~defor purposes other than those mentioned in the preceding passage
e.g., see C.elsus 5.26, 36; Galen, vol. 12,.p__233). It was also used to sup 
press bleeding (Celsus 5.1).
Celsus (6.12) used the basic lead hydroxides (washed lead or washed cal 
cined lead) mainly for eye salves. These compounds, however, find many
more applications in the rustic or popular remedies of Pliny (34.50): "It
(washed lead) has the property of acting as an astringent and arresting hem 
orrhage and promoting cicatrization. It is of the same utility also in medi 
cine for the eyes, especially preventing their procidence, and for the cavi 
ties or excrescences left by ulcers and for fissures of the anus. For these
purposes lead lotion is extremely efficient, while for creeping or foul ulcers
ash of calcined lead is useful; and the benefit they produce is on the same
lines as in the case of sheets of papyrus," Dioscorides (5.95) repeats-al 
most word for word-what Pliny has said.
The use of metallic rust on wounds is featured in the ancient myth of
Achilles who treated the wound of Telephos with scrapings from the tip of
his lance-an interesting treatment that left Pliny (34.14) wondering as to
"whether he did it with a bronze or an iron spearhead" (Majno, 1975). Be 
cause of their excellent analgesic and styptic properties, the use of lead ox 
ides on wounds began well before the Trojan War (ca. 1250 B.C.), probably
as early as the Stone Age. The discovery of cupellation around 4000 B.C.
provided ample supplies of the lead oxides, which could have further en 
couraged their general use in medicaments. The Papyrus Ebers-a com 
pendium of ancient Egyptian drugs in use before 1550 B.c.-contains about
30 medicaments calling for red lead or "lead earth" (Bryan, 1930). The
Hearst Medical Papyrus, a poorly organized medical practioners' recipe
book compiled ca. 1550 B.C. (Leake, 1952), also has several confections
containing lead oxides.
About 20% of all the red-lead prescriptions in the Papyrus Ebers are for
'the treatment of eye diseases; ailments so treated include xanthelasma,
pterygium, blindness, and squint (Bryan, 1930). All forms of infectious
conjunctivitis were widespread in Egypt, and the common use of leaden
collyria is not surprising. Indeed, such collyria, bearing the most ancient
seals, were found in Alexandria (Castiglioni, 1943). It is also interesting
that most of the prescriptions containing red lead are for external applica 
tions-mostly as pastils, emollients, and plasters for burns, wounds, ul 
cers, and alopecia; also as poultices to drive away tremblings in the fin 
gers, to make the "met" supple, and to draw out splinters from the flesh;
and as ear plugs to cure loss of hearing or injected into the ear that dis 
charge foul-smelling matter (Bryan, 1930). Rarely did remedies for internal
disorders contain lead. The only instance, in fact, is the use of lead salts to
alleviate constipation. It may be noted that the Berlin medical papyrus,
compiled about 200 years later, still contains several of the prescriptions
that are the same as, or similar to, those in the Ebers and Hearst papyruses
(Leake, 1952). The use of medicaments containing fresh lead earth for
tongue diseases and to strengthen the teeth (Bryan, 1930, p, 11 1) would
seem to be ill-advised.

The Assyrian-Babylonian pharmacopoeia was extraordinarily extensive
(Kuchler, 1904; Levey, 1966; Majno , 1975). One survey showed the ther 
apeutic use of 250 medicinal plants, 120 mineral substances, and 180 other
drugs not containing those used as solvents and vehicles for the actual me 
dicinal substances (Leix, 1940). Among them are several lead compounds
that are still to be properly identified. The medicinal use of lead by these
ancient cultures is suggested by the records that speak of an important
traffic in drugs between Babylon and Egypt as early as 2250 B.C. (Castig 
Iioni, 1945). The strong influence of Egyptian medicine on the pre-Hippo 
cratic medicine in Bronze Age Greece has also been noted by several au 
thorities (e.g., Ghalioungui, 1965; Partington, 1970; Warren, 1970). The
possibility that some of the lead used for medicaments in Dynastic Egypt
came from Greece (i.e., the Laurion mines) has been raised (Gale and
Stos-Gale, 1981). The point to be emphasized here is that because of ex 
tensive trade and cultural links , the therapeutical applications of lead com 
pounds by many ancient cultures of the Mediterranean region are likely to
have been similar to those of ancient Egypt, as they are recorded in the
Papyrus Ebers and the Hearst Medical Papyrus.
The pseudo-Hippocratic collection has about 30 medicaments with lead
oxides-all for the treatment of de ulceribus, de fistulis, de mulierum mor 
his, and de natura muliebri (Partington, 1970, p. 32). Galen, Celsus, and
their disciples used great numbers of saturnine drugs. Celsus used litharge
as an exedent (5.7) and minium from Sinope as an erodent (5.6). He used
litharge as an antiseptic (5.5), to check bleeding (5.19) and to clean wounds
(5.19), and he also applied it to putrid flesh (5.19), to pustules (5.28), and
to nasal ulcerations (6.7). For wounds, Celsus (5.19) has a list of 34 plas 
ters and ointments, 18 of which contain heavy doses of lead oxides. Paulus
Aegineta (7.17) provides a very comprehensive list of 90 ancient plasters
(compiled mainly from Dioscorides, Galen, and Oribasius). Thirty eight of
these contain lead salts (see Table 6.2). The following directions on how to
prepare lead-oxide plasters are from the works of Antyllus (cited by Paulus
Aegineta 7.17):
In the boiling of the medicines, the litharge will be boiled with the oil; but
the litharge having been previously triturated, is to be triturated again with
the oil, so as to become viscid, and then it is to be boiled at a gentle fire,
stirring incessantly. At first, then, it swells and bubbles; but when nearly
boiled sufficiently, it becomes of a more feculent colour. It has attained its
measure of boiling when the swelling subsides, and it no longer stains. The
molybdaena is to be boiled in a manner similar to litharge; but the measure
of the boiling of it is not only when it ceases to stain, but when it changes
from a fiery colour to a yellow and strongly floridone.
Pliny (34.53) succinctly summarized the medicinal applications of lead ox 
ides in antiquity; "If [molybdena, a lead oxide] is used in preparing a par 
ticular emollient plaster for soothing and cooling ulcers and in plasters
which are not applied with bandages but which they use as a liniment to

Lead Exposure and Lead Poisoning Nonoccupational Exposure 365
promote cicatrization on the bodies of delicate persons and on the more
tender parts. It is a composition of three pounds of sulphide of lead and
one of wax with half a pint of oil, which is added with solid lees of olives
in the case of an elderly patient. Also combined with scum of silver and
~ros~,oflea~,~ti~applied warm for fomenting dysentery and constipa 
tion. The similarity between the preceding prophylactic usage of these
compounds and the much earlier records in the Papyrus Ebers and the
Hearst medical papyrus is obvious.
I~shoul.d be furthernot~dthat Galen (vol. 12, p. 225) prescribed litharge
for mtertrigo, but he considered the application of litharge on wounds to
be a useless. treatment (Galen, vol. 10, p. 196). Virgil (Georgics 3, line 449)
notes that htharge was used for treating scabies in sheep. Celsus recom 
mended minium (lead oxide or cinnabar adulterated with lead oxides) as an
antiseptic (5.5-6, 19, 6.6) and for the treatment of nasal polypus and foul
genital ulcerations (6.17). Lead oxides were at times ingredients in eye
salves (Celsus 6.6; Paulus Aegineta 7.16). Archagathos (ca. 220 B.C.), who
was credited with introducing Greek medicine to Rome (see Celsus 5.19'
~liny29.6), invented a plaster containing misy, burnt copper, white lead:
litharge, and turpentine resin. Herakleides of Tarentum (ca. 75 B.C.) listed
many prescriptions containing litharge, alum, vitriol, vendigris, white lead,
copper scales, galls, earth wax, cocus, turpentine, and opium. Menekrates
of Zeophleta (ca. the first century A.D.) is reputed to have invented the di 
achylon plaster(v~r~popular in ancient times) that contained litharge, oil,
marrow, and herb JUIces (Partington, 1970, pp. 184, 188-189).
The medicinal properties of white lead (ceruse, psimithium, or sugar of
lead) basically' 'are the same as those of other lead compounds mentioned
a?~ve,only it is the mildest of them all, and beside that, it is useful for
g~vmg.wome.na fair complexion" (Pliny 34.54). It is a very common ingre 
dient In ancient ophthalmic medicines or collyria (see Table 6.2). About
one half of the 55 ancient ophthalmic collyria listed by Paulus Aegineta
(7.16) contain white lead (Table 6.2). The most popular of all the Roman
c.ollyria, .however,. seems .to have been the collyrium of Cythion or Teth 
non, WhICh contained opium, lead oxide, acacia juice, gum, starch, and
tragacanth (Castiglioni, 1945). These ingredients were rubbed together,
mI.xed WIth~smallqu~ntityof rainwater, and then applied to the appro 
pnate areas In complaints of the eyes, tonsils, and suppurated ears. 80 
ranus (2.14) suggests the anointment of any part of an infant bruised in de 
liver~with wh.ite lead, while Celsus (6.17) recommends the application of
aw~lte-Ieadointment to the umbilicus of prominent navels, in order that
surgical measures need not be used.
So'! orinkst~ne.-amixture of lead, iron, and copper sulfates-was
used m a prescnption for loosening a carious tooth (Celsus 6.9). Many
other by-products of lead pyrometallurgy were also used in ancient medi 
cam~nts,mostly as constitutents of plasters, cataplasms, emollients, and
pastils, Examples notedby ancient authorities include slag of silver, dross
of lead, golden ash, flower of silver, lead stone, and spuma plumbi, cad 
mea spodos, and so forth. The efficacy of these secondary materials may
be exemplified by those of scoria arg enti (Pliny 33.35), which is said to be
a by-product of the lead-smelting process. "It has an astringent and cool 
ing effect on the body, and like sulphuret of lead, of which we shall speak
in dealing with lead, it has healing properties as an ingredient inplasters,
being extremely effective in causing wounds to close-up, and when in 
jected by means of syringes, together with myrtle-oil, as a remedy for
straining of the bowels and dysentery. It is also used as an ingredient in
the remedies called emollient plasters used for proud flesh of gathering
sores, or sores caused by chafing or funning ulcers on the head." One can
certainly appreciate Pliny's (34.51) remark on the "marvellous efficacy of
human experiment, which has not left even the dregs of substances and the
foulest refuse untested in such numerous ways. "
We can surmise that many ancient medicaments were contaminated
with lead. Most ores of copper and zinc contain lead, and the various drugs
using the drosses of the two metals would therefore have also contained
lead. This would hold true too for medications employing calcined brass
and bronze. Dioscorides (5.84) notes that one of the frequently used zinc
preparations (calamine) was often contaminated with lead from the scoriae.
The efficacy of some of the metallic drugs may be due-at least in part 
to their lead contents. A small number of such metallic drugs were used
internally (Celsus 2.12).
Galen (On Antidotes 1.2; see Brock, 1929, p. 199) was particularly wary
of the widespread adulteration of commercially available drugs:
I also sailed to Lemnos, and for no reason (as the gods know) than to get the
Lemnian earth or "seal," whichever it is called. This then-whether we call
it Lemnian earth or Lemnian seal-they counterfeit, so that nobody is able
to distinguish the true from the false. Like the so-called Indian lycium and
many other substances, in which the distinction of genuine from counterfeit
is difficult to make, these should be collected by people who travel to the
countries in question...."
The adulteration of the Lemnian miltos or rubrica (red earth) with the
cheaper red lead is not inconceivable.
The use of leaden pestles and mortars would have been another com 
mon source of contamination. The use of lead mortars and pestles seems
to have been particularly favored by ancient physicians for the preparation
of cold, astringent liquors (e.g., Aurelianus Chronic Diseases 4.44; Milne,
1907). The large number of these implements found at Olynthus suggests
that their use was quite common (Robinson, 1941). A number of leaden jars
have been found for storing medicaments (Milne, 1907), and they seem to
be favored in storing solid substances (Castiglioni, 1945). Dioscorides gave
precise instructions concerning containers for various medicaments to en 
sure that the remedies retained their efficacy. He recommended that the
</p>
</div1>
<div1 id="page_30" n="30" type="page">
<p>remedies for eye diseases and those containing vinegar, tar, and other res 
ins be stored in lead or pewter boxes. Galen (vol. 14, p. 48), however, has
some reservations about the use of such leaden containers.
Ancient physicians frequently prescribed boiled-down must and wines
for a wide variety of ailments. According to Hippocrates (On Regimen in
Acute Diseases, Ch. 4):
One must determine by such marks as these, when sweet, strong and dark
wine, hydromel, water and oxmel, should be given in acute diseases. Where 
fore the sweet affects the head less than the strong, attacks the brain less,
evacuates the bowels more than the other, but induces swelling of the spleen
and liver; it does not agree with bilious people, for it causes them to thirst;
it creates flatulence in the upper part of the intestinal canal, but does not dis 
agree with the lower part, as far as regards flatulence; and yet flatulence en 
gendered by sweet wine is not of a transient nature, but rests for a long time
in the hypochondria. And therefore it in general is less deuretic than wine
which is strong and thin; but sweet is more expectorant than the other. But
when it creates thirst, it is less expectorant in such cases than the other wine,
but if it does not create thirst, it promotes expectoration better than the
other.
This opening section was followed by a detailed account of the "excellent
examples of the beneficial and injurious effects of wine, all of which were
left undetermined by my predecessors." Celsus (2.30), as well as Galen
(vol. 13, p. 45, vol. 15, p. 632), prescribed boiled-down must, while every
ancient medical text extant has a therapeutic use for wine. The basic dis 
tinction between the consumption of such beverages (that are prone to lead
contamination) as food or medicine is certainly not very distint. Further 
more, sapa, defrutum, and wines were extensively used as sweetners, sol 
vents, or vehicles for the medicinal ingredients. Wines and boiled-down
must thus should be considered as a common source of lead in medica 
ments used internally. There is nothing in the literary records to suggest
that the ancient physicians were aware of the lead contamination of their
medications or ascribed any ill-effects to the lead adulteration.
There was, of course, the fraudulent adulteration of ancient medica 
ments with lead. Pliny (34.25) spoke forcefully on this matter: "But of all
these facts the doctors, if they will permit me to say so, are ignorant-they
are governed by names: so detached they are from the process of making
up drugs, which used to be the special business of the medical profession.
Nowadays whenever they come on books of prescriptions, wanting to
make up some medicines out of them, which means to make trial of the
ingredients in the prescriptions at the expense of their unhappy patients,
they rely on the fashionable druggists' shops which spoil everything with
fraudulent adulterations, and for a long time they have been buying plas 
ters and eye-salves ready made; and thus is deteriorated rubbish of com 
modities and the fraud of the druggists' trade put on show." It is equally
And cinnabar and red lead are admitted to be poisons, all the current instruc 
tions on the subject of its employment for medicinal purposes are in my
ion decidedly risky, except perhaps that its application to the head or stom 
ach arrests hemorrhage, provided that it does not find access to the vital
organs or come in contact with a lesion, In any other way for my own part
I would not recommend its employment.
The application of lead compounds to excoriated skins over an extended
period of time could, however, lead to chronic, if not acute, leadpoiso~ing
(see Baker, 1767; Tanquerel des Planches, 1839), A number of medica 
ments used internally were contaminated with lead either fraudulently or
from the use of leaden, or lead-tainted, morters, pestles, jars, and dis?C
n 
satories. The maceration of the medicinal ingredients with wine or boiled 
down must would be another important source of lead contamination in an-
cient medicaments.
The ancient peoples were very much aware of the effects ?f leado~the

inauspicious that at the time of the Roman Empire, apothecaries were
sometimes called pigmentarii-a term denoting dealers in
paints- but it also referred to those who prepared the medicines ordered
by the physicians, as has been remarked previously by Pliny. Lead
ments were quite common in Roman times (see Chapter 5), and some
ventitious lead contamination of drugs might have been occasioned the
use of improperly cleaned shop equipment and dispensatories,
The preceding review of the extant literary sources of the Old World
thus indicates that saturnine preparations were rarely prescribed for inter 
naluse. Pliny (33.41) rightly tells us why not:

tamination of wines and hydrmel-oxymel, Oribasios (Medical Collection
10.23) states that collyria, which often contain lead (see Table 6.2), were
applied to the uterus, presumably for contraceptive purposes.
In the eclectic compilation On Medicine in Sixteen Books or Discourses
Aetios of Amida (16.16) notes that "smearing the cervix before coitus with
honey or cedar resin alone, or in combination with lead or liquid ointment
~ithmyrtle and~eador liquid alum or galbanum with wine, aids contracep 
tion. These medicaments, when they are astringent, unctuous and refriger 
ant, close the orifice of the womb before coitus and prevent the sperm of
the man from entering the uterus." He continues by saying (16.17): "Or
else, (prepare) lead with oil in pessary; put in the vagina before coitus or
sooner."
Several moralists and satirists-notably 81. Jerome, Juvenal, and Mar 
tial-spoke about the practice, which was relatively common among
women at the time of the Roman Empire, of drinking potions with the in 
tention of preventing conception or inducing abortion. The following ex 
cerpts from Juvenal may be indicative of the general deprivation of his age:
At the moment, when Julia was relieving her fertile womb and giving birth to
abortions that display similitude of her uncle. (Satires 3.35)
So great is the skill, so powerful the drugs, of the abortionists, paid to mur 
der mankind within the womb. Rejoice, poor wretch; give her the stuff to
d~inkwhatever it may be, with your own hand: for were she willing to get
big and trouble her womb with bouncing babes, you might perhaps find your 
self the father of an Ethiopian: and some day a coloured heir, whom you
would rather not meet by daylight, would fill all the places in your will. (Sat 
ires 6.595)
There is no way of knowing the number of such contraceptive decoctions
if any, that contained lead as an active ingredient. '
Lead was also featured in the treatment of other diseases of women.
The Hippocratic corpus referred to the use of leaden instruments to dilate
the cervix (Littre 8, pp. 281, 427). Leaden tubes for intrauterine medication
and.forinsertio~into the vagina and rectum to prevent postoperative ci 
catncal contractIons and adhesions are mentioned (Milne, 1907, p. 15). Mal
Samuel (ca. 180-254 A.D.)-rabbi, physician, astronomer, and one of the
most important sages of the Talmud-recommended the use of "leaden
tubes whose edge is bent inwards" for examining the uterus (Niddah: 66a;
Rosner, 1977, p. 164). The use of lead oxides in the treatment of ulcerous
wombs is recommended in the Hippocratic text (Littre 8, pp. 117, 219,
265). Galen (vol. 8, pp. 645-646, 939) and Celsus (5.15, 18, 27) prescribed
lead salts for ulcers, abscesses, and indurations of the breast. The lead ap 
plied to such private parts may exert an adverse health effect. Indeed, Sir
George Baker (1767, p. 206) reported a case of "most violent and obstinate
colic, which seemed to have been occasioned by some litharge mixed in
cataplasm and applied to the vagina with a view to allay a troublesome
itching. "
There are a few other anecdotes on saturnine drugs. The excavations of
a Roman military hospital near Baden in Switzerland has yielded bottles of
leaden ointments (Kolbert, 1909). The Bible did not specifically mention
any saturnine medicaments, but among the remedies mentioned in the Tal 
mud are various powders, potions, plasters, and collyria (Rosner, 1977, p.
16; Preuss, 1978, ch. 15) that probably included lead as an ingredient. For
the treatment of rushcheta, a mixture of aloe, gum arabic juice, white lead
(aspidka), litharge (martika), malabathrum berries, and glaucium has been
recommended by the Talmud. All the ingredients are to be placed in a thin
rag in summer or in cotton wool in winter and then be applied to the site
of the ailment (Gittin, p. 69b; Preuss, 1978, p. 185).
Unlike the situation in the West, the consumption of mineral elixirs and
drugs assumed a religious fervor in ancient China and other ancient cul 
tures of the East. The basic features of Chinese wei tan and nei tan al 
chemy pertaining to macrobiotics or physiological medicine of longevity
and material immortality have been articulated nicely by Needham (1974,
p. 11):
Macrobiotics is a convenient term for the belief that it is possible to prepare,
with the aid of botanical, zoological, mineralogical and above all chemical,
knowledge, drugs or elixirs (tan) which will prolong human life beyond old
age (shou lao), rejuvenating the body and its spiritual parts so that the adept
(chen jen) can endure through centuries of longevity (chhang sheng), finally
attaining the status of eternal life and arising with etherealised body as a true
Immortal (sheng hsien). Such was the Taoist concept of material immortality.
... But there was another predisposing cause for alchemical ideas in China,
the absence of any prejudice against the use of mineral drugs analogous to
that which existed so long under the Galenical domination in Europe; indeed
the Chinese went to the other extreme, compounding with remarkable per 
sistence through the centuries all kinds of dangerous elixirs containing me 
tallic and other elements (mercury, arsenic, lead, etc., as well as gold) which
caused untold harm to those who resolutely took them. However the Taoist,
if he chose, could avoid these dangers, for there were many other techniques
available in the quest for material immortality, not only alchemical and phar 
maceutical but also dietetic, respiratory, gymnastic, sexual, heliotherapeutic
and meditational. With all these could he aspire to incorporation into the
ranks of the invisible bureaucracy of the universe as a Heavenly Immortal
(thien hsien); or else seek for transformation into a ti hsien, an Earthly Im 
mortal, purified, ethereal and free, able to spend the rest of eternity wander 
ing as a kind of wraith through the mountains and forests, enjoying the com 
pany of similar enlightened spirits and the cycle of the seasons ever repeated
yet with glory ever renewed. These are the beings that one can discern, tiny
against the immensity of the landscape, flitting across remote ravines in many
beautiful Chinese paintings.
Compared to Hellenistic chemistry, the Chinese alchemistry was much
closer to medicine than to metallurgy, with the result that the use of inor 
ganic and metallic substances in therapy began in remote antiquity. A com-

pendium of chemical substances in the text, Chi Ni Tzu (presumed to be of
fifth century B.C. vintage) listed metallic lead and a number of its com 
pounds which probably had pharmaceutical uses (see Needham, 1976,
p. 14). The legendary Shunyu I (ca. 216-147 B.C.), who has left us with one
of the earliest records of the medicinal uses of inorganic substances (The
Five Minerals), had in his possession a book entitled Discussion on the
Use ofMineral Drugs which probably dates to at least the second half of
the third century B.C. (Needham, 1976, p. 47). The earliest Chinese phar 
macopoeia extant, Shen Nung Pen Tshao Ching, lists 41 inorganic sub 
stances, including mercury and cinnabar. The manuscript, considered to be
of Early Han and presumably containing material from Chou and Warring
States period, notes that cinnabar is "found in mountain valleys, its sa 
pidity is sweet and slightly cold, it controls the hundred diseases of the
body and the five viscera, it nourishes the ching and shen vitalities, calms
the hun and pho 'souls,' benefits the chhi, clears the eyes, kills mei para 
sites and destroys malignant humors (hsieh 0 chhi). It can change into mer 
cury (hung). If taken constantly it puts one in touch with spiritual beings
and gives longevity (thung shen ming pu lao)." The text highlights the
main point of interest here, namely, that the toxic mineral drugs were used
internally from very early times. Needham (1974, 1976) has presented a
near-catalog of ancient emperors, high officials, and adepts who ingested
such metallic elixir preparations that undoubtedly included the lead salts.
The literary records suggest that elixir preparations made from lead and
other toxic metals began to be consumed in heavy doses or administered
on long-continued basis during the Later Han, or about the first or second
century A.D. (Needham, 1976, p. 45). For many centuries after that, the
adepts and their disciples continued the hard and painful process of testing
the effects of metallic preparations upon the human mind and body. It
would be quite unwise and fortuitous to even try to follow the web of ref 
erences to the saturnine elixirs. Sivin (1968) has found over 1000 titles on
elixirs of immortality in the alchemical literature, while Okanishi Tameto
(1936) indexed 2405 recipes for elixirs (defined by the occurrence of the
word tan in the title) in only 321 medical compilations. A few examples
will suffice to show that large amounts of lead were often employed in the
preparation of some common elixirs.
In Tshan Thung Chhi (Kingship of the Three), dated to about 142 A.D.,
Wei Po-Yang, who is widely regarded as the father of alchemy, gave de 
tailed instructions for the preparation of the famous "cyclically trans 
formed elixir" (see Needham, 1976, p. 73):
Chin (lead, or the metal) is used as an embankment (to prevent mercury
from escaping), so that shui (mercury) can be put in and run about freely.
The amount of chin is fifteen (oz.) and so is the amount of shui (mercury).
Weighings should be made when the furnace is about to be heated. An ex 
cess amount of shui (mercury) by half should be used. These are the two gen 
uine substances. The weight of chin will be the same as it was originally. A
third (substance) therefore does not come in. But whenfir~(,which is also
represented by the number) Two is introduced ,thes.e three WIll mterpenetrate
each other and marvellous changes (pien hua ) will take place. Belo:v (the
reaction-vessel) is the chhi of Thai-Yang (i.e. the fire). After~~ho~time of

As the time (lit. month and year) draws to a close, the nature (of the ongmal
substances) is destroyed and their life shortened. (Eventually a transforma 
tion of) their form and matter comes about giving a sort of powdery ash, re-
sembling 'bright window dust.'
(The substance) is ground, mixed well and ,enclosed (in another reaction-ves 
sel) before being introduced into the opening of a red(-ho~furnace), Atten 
tion should be paid to the sealing of the edges of the container so as to keep
the whole intact without leaking. The dazzling flame plays below. making a
noise both day and night. At the start the flame should be gentle.s~as to be
controllable, but eventually its strength should be increased until It reaches
maximal intensity. The regulation of the temperature should be watched over
with the greatest care. There arc twelve periods in the (diurnal) cycle.A~
the end of each period one should be particularly careful. When .the chhi
(i.e. the fire) is about to be let down, the (original) bodies have been killed, and
the hun and pho 'souls' have disappeared (Le. the substances h,avech,ange~

Unfortunately, Wei Po-Yang did not say what chinan~shui, the t:v

ingredients, were. An anonymouscommentato~surmised~hatch~nre~re&#173;

only "a knife-point of it" was all that was required.
Ko Hung (ca. 283-343 A.D.), the systematizer of~hinesealchemy,
maintained that material immortality could only be attamed ?y the con 
sumption of one of the major elixirs such as huan tan (cychcallytran~&#173;
formed elixir) and chin i (portable gold elixir). He devoted Chapter 4 of hIS
Pao Phu Tzu (Nei Phien) (Book of thePreservation-of-Solidarit~~aster:
Esoteric Chapters) exclusively to the preparation and types of elixirs (see
Wu Lu-Chhiang and Davis, 1932; Ware, 1966;Needh~m,1~76,?p. 75 
113). Of the 27 elixirs listed, cinnabar was used as an ingredient m~1.of
them, mercury in about 12, and realgar in 8 instances.~helead-contammg
elixirs and preparations included tan hua (a deadly mixture of mercury,
realgar, alum, lead, lead carbonate, salt, red bole clay, oyster shells, soap 
stone, and other ingredients); thai-chhing tan (a mixture~fmercury and~ts
salts, lead, gold, vinegar, mineral sulfates, and so on); yin tzu tan fa (cin

cle) and chou hou tan fa (cinnabar, mercury, lead, and copper or one of its
alloys) (Needham, 1976, pp. 90-92).
Ko Hung-rather uncharacteristically-described a relatively detailed
procedure for the preparation of tan hua or "elixir flower" (Needham,
1976, p. 83); "The first elixir is called 'elixir flower' (tan hua). One should
first prepare hsilan huang ('mysterious yellow ingredient,' presumably a
lead-mercury amalgam or a mixture of the two metal oxides). Add to it a
solution of realgar and a solution of alum. Take several dozen pounds each
of rough Kansu salt (jung yen), crude alkaline salt (lu hsien), alum, pow 
dered oyster shells, red bole clay, (powdered) soapstone, and lead carbon 
ate; and with these make the Six-One Lute [and seal (the reaction vessel)
with it]. After 36 days heating the elixir will be completed, and anyone who
takes it continuously for 7 days will become an immortal. Now if this elixir
is made into pills with "mysterious fat" (hsiian kao) and placed upon a
fierce fire, it will very quickly turn into gold. Gold can also be made by
taking 240 chu (10 oz) of this elixir and adding it to 100 catties (lb) of mer 
cury, then upon heating, it will all turn into gold. If this works, we know
that the elixir is right. Ifit does not, reseal the constituents and heat for as
long as before. This never fails. "
The paradigmatic process described above has been the subject of con 
flicting interpretations (Chikashige, 1936; Needham, 1976, p. 84), and the
mention of projective aurification is certainly noteworthy. The ancient text
Huang Ti Chiu Ting Shen Tan Ching Chueh [Explanation of the Yellow
Emperor's manual of the nine-vessel magical elixir], which contains mate 
rial earlier than Ko Hung's time, gives the composition of hsiian huang as
10 lb of mercury and 20 lb of lead (Ware, 1966, pp. 78-79). Another alchem 
ical text, the Thai-Chhing Chin I Shen Tan Ching [Manual of the portable
gold and magicalel~xir-aThai-Chhing scripture], states that hsuan huang
IS prepared by heatmg 9 lb of mercury and 1 lb of lead in an earthenware
vessel over a strong fire from morning until dusk (Needham, 1976, p. 85).
The consumption of such elixirs that contained large quantities of toxic
metals certainly would have been an anathema to the health of the adepts.
The Thang theoretical treatise Tan Lun Chiieh. Hsin Ching [Mental Mir 
ror Reflecting the Essentials of Oral Instruction about the Discourse on the
Elixir and the Enchymoma] saw a close parallel between geological proc 
esses and the preparation of the familiar cyclically transformed elixirs
(Needham, 1980, p. 232):
Natural cyclically-transformed elixir (tzu-jan huan tan) is formed when flow 
ing mercury (liu hung), embracing Sir Metal (chin kung==chhien, lead), be 
comes pregnant. Wherever there is cinnabar there are also lead and silver. In
43~Oy~arsth.e elixir isfinis~ed.Realgar (hsiung) to its left, orpiment (tzhu)
to Its right, cinnabar above It, malachite (tsheng chhing) below. It embraces
the. chhi of sun and moon, Yin and Yang, for 4320years; thus, upon repletion
of Its own chhi, it becomes a cyclically-transformed elixir for immortals of
the highest grade and celestial beings. When in the world below lead and
mercury are perfected by an alchemical process (hsiu lien) for purposes of
immortality, (the elixir) is finished in one year. The fire is first applied in the
eleventh month, when the Single Yang (i Yang) comes into being, and the
elixir is finished by the eleventh month of the next year. The natural cycli 
cally-transformed elixir is what immortals, celestial beings, and sages of the
world above gather and eat. What (the alchemist) now prepares succeeds be 
cause of its correspondence on a scale of thousandths (hsiang erh chheng
chih, ta chhien chih shu). Taking the product also results in eternal life,
transformation into a feathered being, and power (kung'') equal to that of
heaven.
We shall return shortly to the association of cinnabar with lead ores in re 
lation to the lead-mercury theory of metallotherapy.
Simple and practical details for the preparation of saturnine elixirs are
given in the text Thai-Chhing Tan Ching Yao Chueh [Essentials of the
Elixir Manuals for Oral Transmission, a Thai-Chhing Scripture], written
ca. 640 A.D. by Sun Ssu-Mo (ca. 581-672 A.D.). He listed 67 different elix 
irs but gave the recipes for only 32, most of which entailed large quantities
of lead, mercury, and/or arsenic as the active ingredients (Sivin, 1968, pp.
145-214). Thus, the formula for a "minor cyclically transformed elixir"
was given by Sun Ssu-Mo as 4 oz of amorphous sulfur, 1 lb of mercury,
3 oz of massicot, and 1 oz of gold. The mixture is to be forcefully ground
fine, heated in a tightly sealed lute for seven days and nights, cooled for
half a day and the product made into pills, using jujube pulp as the vehicle
(Sivin, 1968, p. 175). On the dosage and efficacy of such an elixir, Sun Ssu 
Mo says: "Every day after eating, take three pills wrapped in jujubes. It
cures epilepsy, melancholia, possession by goblins, and so forth. Taken
over a long period, it hardens the bones and marrow, aids circulation of
the blood, moistens the skin, brings out color in the face, quiets the soul,
and puts one in touch with the immortals." The osteological effect of
overexposure to lead is properly adduced, and the remark that the elixir
"puts one in touch with the immortals" is not at all surprising.
For making the "lead elixir," Sun Ssu-Mo recommends 4 lb of lead rip 
ened in fire and 1 lb of quicksilver cleaned by grinding with salt. Details
for preparing the elixir are given as follows (Sivin, 1968, pp. 187-188):
Take two tou of millet and steam it until the grains decompose. When it is
ready, make it into vinegar by adding vinegar leaven and stopping it up
tightly for five or six days. Next take earth collected from cart tracks, sift it,
and put it into the container, stirring to mix, until the contents resemble
wheat paste which has been fried in cakes. Take the lead, melt it, and pour
it into the paste and mix. After mixing, heat the lead again in a good footed
vessel until melted. Warm the mercury and pour it into one chin of the lead.
Wait until the whole flows and then resolidifies. Bind it with cord and sus 
pend it in a kettle [of vinegar] for 14 days. Its essence will of itself descend
into the vinegar. Collect it and wash it clean. Mix it with one liang each of
mirabilite and Epsom salts [MgS0
4&#183;7H2
0 ]. Sublime the combination three
times, three days for each cycle, following the method for preparing the elixir

sublimation. Collect the essence and mix it with cooked rice to form pills,
each the size of hempseed. It will cure anyone afflicated with disorder due to
hot factors, possession by demonic forces, epilepsy, and autumnal intermit 
tent fevers.
The principle of sympathies is again evident, and the use of the lead elixir
seems to be predicated upon the cooling and chthonic properties of lead.
The common association of lead and mercury in all of these elixirs
should have become quite evident. Mahdihassan (1979) has noted that the
prehistoric Chinese and other ancient cultures regarded blood as the vehi 
cle for the soul, and they typically associated blood with redness. In es 
sence, soul = blood = redness, or bright-red ore. Mahdihassan maintains
that the ancient peoples smeared their dead initially with a red ocher, later
with red lead (minium) and/or cinnabar. Since the prehistoric Chinese
could not readily differentiate between minium and cinnabar (for a similar
confusion in the Hellenistic world, see Chapter 5), they were able to re 
cover lead or mercury from the pyrometallurgical treatment of the propi 
tious red ores. Consequently, blood =soul = (the propitious red mineral) ==
lead + mercury. The two elements and their compounds thus became ubiq 
uitous among the drugs of immortality or longevity. Indeed, few other peo 
ple interred cinnabar or minium-its common adulterant-with the dead,
nor did they take it orally as a drug or elixir in such quantities as the an 
cient Chinese (Mahdihassan, 1979). Such a conceptual association perhaps
formed the basis of their lead-mercury theory of metallotherapy.
One of the earliest recipes for the lead-mercury elixir is given in the Yel 
low Emperor's Canon of the Nine-Vessel Spiritual Elixirs, written before
142 A.D. (Needham, 1980, p. 255). For preparing the "black-and-yellow"
(hsiian huang), an intermediate step in the synthesis of the nine elixirs, the
Canon advocates (see Needham, 1980, p. 256):
Take ten pounds of quicksilver and 20 pounds of lead. Put them into an iron
vessel, and make the fire underneath intense. The lead and the quicksilver
will emit a f1.oreate essence (ching hua). This floreate essence will be purple,
or in some cases may resemble yellow gold in color. With an iron spoon, join
it together and collect it. Its name is "Black and Yellow," and it is also
named "Yellow Essence" (huang ching), "Yellow Sprouts" (huang ya], and
"Yellow Weightless" (huang chhing). The medicine is then put inside a bam 
boo tube and steamed a hundred times. It is mixed with realgar and cinnabar
solutions and volatilized.
At times, however, the "realized lead" (silver) and "realized cinnabar"
(mercury) are used in the elixir preparation. The excerpts in which Meng
Yao-Fu (Sung Dynasty) defined the two paradigmatic terms have already
been cited (see Chapter 1; Needham, 1980, pp. 258-259). Any further dis 
cussion of the lead-mercury theory of metallotherapy would seem irrele 
vant to the present chapter. It may be noted in passing that such a concept
was the subject of a ninth century A.D. treatise Chhien Hung Chia Keng
Chih Pao Chi Chheng [The complete compedium on the lead-mercury a-g
perfected treasure] by Chao Nai-An. The text gives the following recipe for
the "yellow sprouts great elixir" (see Needham, 1980, p. 294):
Orphiment, 0.5 oz; sal ammoniac and arsenic, 0.25 oz each. First grind the
orphiment; then grind the arsenic and sal ammoniac separately, fine as flour.
Take an egg and make a hole in it. Get rid of the yolk but keep the white.
Spread half the arsenic and sal ammoniac on the bottom inside the egg; put
the orphiment in the middle, and half the arsenic and sal ammoniac to cover
it. Take somewhat less than half an egg-shell to cover the hole, and seal it on
with iron oxide solution (chiang fan shui) which has been mixed with the
egg-white. Then take a pound of minium (huang tan) and an iron reaction
vessel (ting). Put half the minium into the vessel and place in its center the
medicines in the egg. Then cover them with the rest of the minium, applying
a little pressure. Fill the vessel with lime (shih hui) and lute it tightly. Using
half a pound of charcoal, heat it gently in an ash bath. When it is taken out,
it will be finished.
It would be futile to describe other potentially deadly saturnine elixirs that
have been cited frequently in many other ancient Chinese texts and in 
scriptions. The few examples I have given should be sufficient to suggest
that any adepts habituated to such elixirs were liable to have suffered lead
poisoning. Perseverance in the taking of the elixirs was counseled repeat 
edly in many of the ancient texts (see Needham, 1974, p. 283)-a rather
unfortunate piece of advice. There is also ample evidence that large num 
bers of the members of ancient Chinese society indulged in the practice of
taking metallic elixirs (see Ho Ping-Vii and Needham, 1959). Metallic-elixir
poisoning certainly hastened the demise of many emperors and high gov 
ernment officials, as is recorded in many ancient texts (see Ho Ping-Vii and
Needham, 1959). It is not inconceivable that such poisoning reached epi 
demic proportions in certain segments of society who could afford the
preparations. Many a purveyor of such elixirs certainly would have re 
ceived unhealthy doses of metallic fumes from the furnaces and reaction
vessels. Metallic poisoning also would have been a serious problem among
the Chinese adepts of the nai tan or "inner elixir" (Lu Gwei-Djen, 1973).
The actual discussion of elixir poisoning will be deferred to the next
section.)
Chinese protoscientific influence becomes increasingly manifested in Ja 
pan from about the beginning of the sixth century A.D. (Needham, 1976,
pp. 174-180). Because the country was richly endowed with gold and sil 
ver, the ancient Japanese generally eschewed the chrysopoia (aurifiction
and aurifaction) dogma, but they eagerly accepted the chemotherapeutic
(elixir) elements of Chinese alchemy. The extant historiographies reveal
that throughout the Heian period (ca. 795-1185 A.D., which is well within
the Japanese Iron Age [see Tylecote, 1976]), the imperial court and mern-
</p>
</div1>
<div1 id="page_35" n="35" type="page">
<p>376 Lead Exposure and Lead Poisoning
bers of the nobility were consistently devoted to longevity medicines de 
rived from plant and metals (Needham, 1976, pp. 178-180). The general
propensity for saturnine drugs and elixirs in ancient Japan is amply docu 
mented by the time-capsule specimens deposited in the Shosoin Treasury
in 756 A.D. and preserved there to this day (Yamasaki, 1954, 1959, 1967;
Masutomi Kazunosuke, 1957). Among the 600 or more items (including 60
substances labeled as "medicines") were 128 small triple-wrapped pack 
ages containing about 100 kilograms of lead oxides. The contents of the
packages were graded into ranks of "superior," "medium," and "low"
quality on the basis of the intensity of the orange-colored powder (Yama 
saki, 1959, 1967). The lead oxides in the packages no doubt were used for
medicinal purposes and in beauty aids.
Chemistry in ancient India also evolved chiefly as a handmaiden of med 
icine and-somewhat later on-as an adjunct of the Tantric cult (Ray,
1956, p. 38). The Vedas-the sacred scriptures of the ancient Hindus 
contain some of the earliest ideas or notions about chemistry and medi 
cine. The Atharva-veda, (ca. the tenth century B.C.), which deals with rec 
ipes for longevity and curing of diseases, regarded gold as an elixir of life
and lead as a dispeller of sorcery (Ray, 1956, p. 38). It contains an inter 
esting incantation dealing with lead:
To the lead
Varuna gives blessings
To the lead
Agni gives help
Indra gave me the lead
Unfailingly dispels sorcery.
Later alchemical and medical texts of ancient India list a catholicity of
herbal, metallic, and herbo-metallic drugs (rasayana) for immortality and/
or longevity (e.g., see Wise, 1867; Hoernle, 1907; Zimmer, 1948; Ray,
1956; Bose et al., 1971; Sherma, 1972; Jaggi, 1973; Mitra, 1974). For ex 
ample, the Siddha system of medicine and practice-followed mostly in the
Tamilnadu (dating to the sixth or seventh century A.D. or earlier)-has
firm ideas about mercury-based elixirs relating to longevity (Bose et al.,
1971, p. 355). The remarkable thing, however, is that lead was rarely an
ingredient in these early rasayama. The exclusion of lead may perhaps be
related to the popular ancient belief that the aged person has a cold body,
whereas the body of a youthful individual is warm (Mahdihassan, 1979,
p. 24). Such a concept of warmth characterizing robust health certainly
would have precluded the use of "cold lead" in any rejuvenation drugs.
Saturnine medicaments-as opposed to rejuvenative drugs-undoubt 
edly were used in ancient India, often as internal remedies. Charaka (ca.
the second century A.D.), who is generally regarded as the first to codify
Nonoccupational Exposure 377
medicine in India, mentions the use of gold, silver copper lead ti d
. II hei , " In, an

In which lead and other metals, as well as their calces, are recommended
for use as drugs (Ray, 1956, p. 65). Lead and zinc were described as ver 
mifugal, and they arereco~~endedfor internal use in the Sushruta (1,
p. 531, 3,. p. 342): The me?Icmal use of lead is also alluded to in many
other ancient Indian canonical texts, such as the Mahiivaggn, Anguttar 
anikiiya, Jataka, Visuddhimagga, Vinaya Pitaka, and so forth (Mitra,
1974).
Galenawa~described as an ingredient in collyria (anjanas) by Charaka,
while leadoXIde~and lead sulfate were prescribed with vegetable drugs for
use as plasters m both the Sushruta Samhita and the Charaka Samhita
(Ray, 1956, pp. 62, 65). Medicinal preparations presumably containing lead
Were used in the eye disease called tim ira (Kddamhari, p. 313; Sherma,
1972, p. 226). The same text iKtidambari, p. 643) also noted that one eye
of the old Dravidian religious man was lost by the use of collyrium named
s iddhanjana (formulary unknown), which was administered by some quack
(Sherma, 1972, p. 226). The Bower Manuscript (pt. 2, p. 131; Hoernle,
1907), which dates to about the second half of the fourth century A.D. but
'Which contains material from a much earlier period, also refers to the use
of galena in medicine.
Alchemical practices really began to blossom in India during the fifth
century A.D. (Bose et al., 1971; Mahdihassan, 1979), and with them came
an ever increasing reliance on metallic-drug preparations. This develop 
ment is clearly reflected in the famous treatise the Astangahridaya, by
Vaghbata (ca. A.D. 800-850), which articulates medical principles of earlier
times. It lists many more prescriptions of lead, gold, silver, copper, iron,
and tin than any other earlier Indian text. One such recipe recommends
roasting in a closed crucible a mixture of 30 parts of lead, 5 parts of sulfur,
2 parts each of copper and orphiment, 3 parts of stibium, and 1 part of tin
(Uttarasthanam, ch. 13, pp. 31-32). For making a collyrium, Vagbhata rec 
ommends equal parts of lead and mercury with an equal weight of stibium
and camphor (Uttarasthanam, ch. 30, p. 36). The days when Vagbhata
lived basically mark a transition in the progress of Hindu medicine, insofar
as materia medica is concerned. Every medical text published after this
period prescribes metallic compounds that can only be synthetically pre 
pared. This contrasts with the largely herbal and vegetable drugs and a few
simple and readily available products of the mineral kingdom used in the
preceding periods (Ray, 1956, p. 108). I shall return to such an historical
development in the next volume. It is of anecdotal interest, however, that
an aboriginal tribe of Bengal-the Santals-use red lead not only for pre 
paring external medicaments, but also as an ingredient in pills that are
either ingested or smoked in a pipe (Bodding, 1927).

<p>ANCIENT DESCRIPTIONS OF LEAD POISONING
The following are some of the important medicinal applications of lead
and its compounds, vis-a-vis the arsenical and mercurials, in the Ayurbedic
system of medicine (Bagchi, 1969, p. 63):
Ancient Descriptions of Lead Poisoning 379
rooted in the cunning manner in which they were administered. In order to
avoid suspicion, the poison was probably given first to the victim in small
quantities, then the dosage was gradually increased until it was decided to
administer a lethal dose. This poisoning strategy could thus wear the guise
of chronic disease, and it is particularly suited to the administration of in 
organic toxins. Stevenson (1949) has, in fact, suggested that such slow poi 
sons sometimes included lead and arsenic.
The use of lead in slow poisons can be rationalized further on the
grounds of the ancient somatological conception of the primary effect of
poisons as being the impairment of vital heat, which then actuates the loss
of sensibility and muscular energy (see Adams, 1844-1847, vol. 2, p. 215;
Stevenson, 1949, p. 7). Considering that lead was widely regarded as a
"cold" metal, its surreptitious use to chill the vital heat would seem rather
logical to the ancient poisoner. At any rate, there is no doubt that they ac 
quired detailed knowledge about the pathological effects of lead and other
metallic poisons. Unfortunately, their craft was guarded with great se 
crecy, and little of their substantial understanding of the mechanisms of
lead toxicity would have been published. Even the study of poisons was
forbidden in the early Christian era, and Galen mentions the fact that only
a few philosophers dared treat the subject in their works (Massengill, 1943,
p. 318).
At this point, it must be stressed that the correct diagnosis of lead poi-
soning has always remained problematic. I recently described the symp 
toms of subclinical lead poisoning to two general practitioners. The doctor
in North America prescribed rest and tranquilizers, while the doctor in a
developing country suspected malaria. Hippocrates and many other an 
cient doctors must have smiled in their graves at these later prognoses.
The problem of correct diagnosis stems from the fact that the symptoms of
lead toxicity are vague. and notoriously nonspecific. At high doses, lead af 
fects many target organs, including the hemopoietic, vascular, renal, he 
patic, cardiovascular, immunological, reproductive, gastrointestinal, en 
dochrine and central nervous systems (Tanquerel des Planches, 1848;
EPA, 1977; WHO, 1977). Indeed, McCord(l95~,p. !25) hasjusti~ablY
called lead poisoning "an aping disease." Its manifestations are sovanabl~
that it may simulate 100 other conditions. The earlysy~ptonsof lead~01&#173;
soning-such as vague abdominal pains, loss of appetite.~eada.che,list 
lessness, clumsiness, fatigue, and nausea-are likely tob~Id~ntlfiedas.a
virus or as some noncritical stress syndrome and thus be dismissed (Davld
et al., 1979; Needleman and Landrigan, 1981). Thesuperveni~gof acute
plumbism cannot always elicit proper diagnosis as the followmg excerpt
from Repko and Corum (1979, p. 141) clearly shOWS:

To a ver:, largedegre~,pharm~cologyowes its early development to "poi 
so~lore -the term Itself being derived from pharmakon, which means
poison (Allbutt, 1921, p. 347). In this light, the preferential use of lead
compounds forext~rnalreme~ie.sin the Ebers and Hearst medical papy 
ruses suggests .genUIne appreciation of the toxic properties of lead at such
an early date (i.e., before .1550 B.C.). Such an empirical knowledge proba

As not.ed in Chapter 1, lead compounds were probably employed in the
secretpOl~onsthat~a~~been featured widely in the history and folklore of
ev~ryancIen~or primitive culture. The history of secret poisons, which is
quite long, lies outside the aims of the present chapter; any interested
reader may refer to Beckmann (1846), Lewin (1920) Allbutt (1921)
Thompson (1925), Massengill (1943), and Bagchi (1969).' Of particularin~

gastric ulcer, acute gastroenteritis, acute porphyria, heat exbauetton, or in 
testinal parasitic infestation.... Similarily, peripheral neuritis, weakness, or
paralysis of the muscular system may be caused by infection, malnutrition,
metabolic disease (diabetes), or arsenic. The central neurological syndromes
are similar to any intracranial pressures, such as infections of the meninges,
neoplasm (tumors), tuberculoma, syphilitic infection, or uremia. Even "lead
line," a black ring on the gums once frequently reported, is not specific to
lead and may be caused by infectious gingivitis, normal pigmentation of dark 
skinned races, bismuth or other metals forming a black sulfide, or dental dis 
coloration due to poor hygiene.
The absence of any unequivocal clinical pattern of symptoms and signs cer 
tainly underscores the fact that ancient doctors were unable to associate
widespread saturnism syndromes with the lead in the food and drink of the
victims. It would have been unusual for an ancient doctor, who based his
clinical diagnosis solely on what the eye saw, the fingers felt, the ears
heard, and the nose smelled, to associate miscarriages and male infertility
with the action of lead. Even if they were unable to ascertain the exact
etiological factor, many an ancient physician, however, displayed unusual
acumen in articulating the symptomology of numerous diseases. On this
score, one can see illusions of lead poisoning manifested by the pathogno 
monic features of many of the case histories recorded in the ancient med 
ical literature. Any interpretation of the syndromes (not directly associated
with ingestion of lead salts) as evidence of lead poisoning must be re 
garded as tentative. This point needs to be borne in mind in reading the
following section.
Some exegetes can see allusions to lead poisoning in a number of syn 
?romes recorded o? the clay tablets of ancient Assyria. One good example
IS as follows (Ebelmg, 1915; von Soden, 1953; translation by Wilson, 1967
p. 725):
The same medical compendium from the library of Ashurbanipal also
described the following interesting syndromes (Kuchler, 1904;Lei~,~940!:
"If a man eats and drinks until he is satiated, and he then has apa~nI~h~s
stomach so that his viscera seem to be on fire and he has colic, It IS
mushekinu," The name for the malady remains to be determined. "If~he
stomach is distended and at the same time there is muscular contraction
and nausea.... If the stomach is puffed up (constipa:ed) and utters
cries.... If the stomach is full of acid.... If the chestI~attack.ed, the
stools liquid like urine, if the neck hurts when one speaks, If there IS vom-
iting." No name was given for the latter syndrom.e. . .
The observed phenomena and symptoms descnbed fit manyc~ronicdIS 
eases, including lead and other metal poisoning. Lead was WIdely~s~d
during the Middle and Late Assyrian periods (C?apter 4),a~dthe~ossibII&#173;
ity of contracting plumbism from food and dnnk contaminatedIn~dver&#173;
tently with lead is not inconceivable. Lead kettles and tumblers dating to
that period are known, and they could be the source of dietary lead.T~e
sequential arrangement for the related prescriptions.in the clay~abletsIS
equally intriguing. The remedies are listed to beg~vensuccessI~elyfor
cases of colic, constipation, vomiting, lack of appetite and VOraCI?Us. ap 
petite, for ineffectiveness of purgatives an? emetics, se.:ere intoxication,
dry cough, gallbladder trouble, andjaun~Iced~yes(Kuchler, 1904). No
less than 14 prescriptions are listed for colic, which WOUld. suggest the rec 
ognition that colic may be due to very different causes (Leix, 1940, p. 679).
It may seem fatuous to state that theprevio~slymention~dsyndromes
pertain to lead poisoning. By the same token,I~seems unlikely that the
Babylonian physicians who were capable of.makmg such acute and. pene 
trating clinical observations would have missed the pathognomonic fea-
.tures of acute lead intoxication. .
The ancient Egyptian medical papyruses also refer to a.c~rnu.C?pIaof
symptoms reminiscent of plumbism-belligerent abdomen, irritability, an 
orexia, myalgia, nausea, lethargy, paralysis, convulsions, and so forth. The
listed therapeutic armamentarium for each syndrome suggests an appre 
hension of possible involvement of multiple causati:e factors. We can only
speculate as to whether lead poisoning was recogmzed as one of the caus 
ative factors.
The Bible and the Talmud contain references to syndromes that are
highly suggestive of lead poisoning. Colic (kolos) is said to. be dangerous,
When Rabbi Joshua ben Levi became ill with kolos, Rabbi Ch.anina.su~&#173;
gested that he pulverize cress, place it in aged wine, and speedily dnnkI~
so that his life not be endangered (Jerushalmi Shabbath 14:14;Jer~shaimi
Abodah Zarah 2:40). The recommended remedy in fact was a typicala~&#173;
cient antidote for lead poisoning. Indeed, Preuss (1978, p. 182)eq~atesthis
ailment with the special type of (lead) colic that Pliny (26.6) claimed first
occurred during the reign of Tiberius, ca. 14-37 A.D. Reference to podagra

<p>2 Chronicles 16:12). In two separate discussions the Babylonian Talmud
commented on King Asa's illness (Sanhedrin 48b; Sotah lOa).
Since kordiakos is mentioned several times in the Talmud but not in the
Old Testament, it may be regarded as a "new" disease. The Jerusalem and
B~bylonia.nTalmuds state (Grittin 7:1; Terumot 1:1): "If a man is seized
wIth. kordiakos and says 'Write a bill of divorce for my wife,' he has said
n~thmg.I~he says, 'Write a bill of divorce for my wife,' and is then seized
with kordiakos and retracted and said, 'Do not write it,' his last words
count for .nothing...." The Talmud gives the following explanation of
what kordiakos represents (Grittin 67b; see Rosner, 1977, p. 61):
What is kordiakos? Samuel said: "Being overcome [lit. bitten] by new wine
from the vat." Then why does it not say if one is overcome by new wine?
The~o~eofe~pressionteaches us that this spirit (or demon which causes
the dIZZIness). IS called kordiakos. Of what use is this [knowledge]? For a
charm. What IS the remedy for it? Red [i.e., without fat] meat broiled on the
coals, and highly diluted wine.
The Jerusalem Talmud further says:
Thesi~nsof a fool [shoteh] are as follows: he goes out at night [alone], he
sleeps In~hecemetery, he tears his clothes, and he loses What he is given.
... Kordiakos has none of the above symptoms. What is kordiakos? R. Jose
a?swers,~amim.A case came before R. Jose concerning a weaver who was
given red m black [diluted red wine or red thread while working with black
threadj] and he ?abbled [Heb.: velu'a, i.e., he talked nonsense]. Then he
was given black In red and he babbled. This is the kordiakos of which the
sage~spoke;. sometimes he is mad and sometimes sane. At a time when he is
consideredh~eama~mani~all respects and when he is sane, he is sane in
~llresp~cts[I.e., a bill of divorce should be written for his wife as per his
instructions], . . .
Theco~ditio.nis thus characterized by confusion, delirium, dizziness, and
mental impairment following the imbibing of new wine from a vat. The Je 
rusale~.Talmud.mak~sit categorically clear that kordiakos does not mean
folly,I~lOSY,.or msaruty. The syndrome is temporary, and is readily cured
by the ingestion of red meat and dilute wine. The identity of kordiakos has
been a matter of controversy (see Jastrow, 1950; Gordon, 1963; Hankoff,
1972;R~sner.,1977; Preuss, 1978). The possibility that lead was involved
as an~tIOlogicalfactor also has to be raised. Heavy wine drinking by the
Jews III the Roman colony in Palestine was common (McKinlay 1950
Mcf'arthy,1~59).As discussed before, there were numerous ways~fcon~
taminatmg WInes with lead at that time.
,!,her~arediv~rgentvi.ews as to whether lead poisoning was actually de 
scnbed m the Hippocratic corpus. The conflicting prognoses for "the dis 
eased~anfrom the mines" (Epidemics 6.25) have already been discussed.
!n addition,ex~geteshave associated other pathological features described
in the corpus with lead poisoning. Littre (vol. 2, pp. 487-497), for example,
identified the following Hippocratean symptoms of dry cholera (On Regi 
men in Acute Diseases, ch. 19) with the dry bellyache of the eighteenth-
century English physicians:
In dry cholera the belly is distended with wind, there is rumbling in the bow 
els, pain in the sides and loins, no dejections, but onth~contrar~:the bowels
are constipated. In such a case you should guard agamst vormtmg, but en 
deavor to get the bowels opened. As quickly as possible give a clyster of hot
water with plenty of oil in it, and having rubbed the patient freely with~n&#173;
guents , put him into hot water, laying~imdown inth~basin, and pouring
the hot water upon him by degrees; and If, when heated In the bath, the bow 
els be moved, he will be freed from the complaint. To a person in suc.h a
complaint it will do good if he sleeps, and drinks a thin, old, and str?n
g
wme;
and you should give him oil, so that he may se:tle, and have hIS ?owels
moved when he will be relieved. He must abstam from all other kmds of
food; but when the pain remits, give him asses' milk to drink~ntilhe .is
purged. But if the bowels are loose, with bilio.
us
d~s:harges,tor~I~a,vomit 
ings, a feeling of suffocation, and gnawing pains, It IS best to enjoin repose,
and to drink hydromel, and avoid vomiting.
Galen (cited in Stevenson, 1949, p. 86) wondered whether the latter part of
the syndrome also referred to dry cholera or was independent of the pre 
ceding account. The similarity between therecomme~dedtherapy and the
ancient remedies for lead poisoning is equally suggestIve. . .
There are also allusions to lead poisoning in a number of the HIppocratIc
aphorisms (see Stevenson, 1949, p. 87):
Those cases in which there are tormina, pains about the umbilicus, and pains
about the loins, not removed either by purgative medicines or otherwise,
usually terminate in dry dropsy. (4.11)
If persons free from fever be seized withtormi~a,heavinesso~thek~ees,
and pains of the loins, this indicates that purgmg downward IS required-
(4.11)
When pains in the joints take place after fevers, the patients are using too
much dainty (contaminated?) foods. (7.65)
The corpus also describes endemic forms of colic andconst~pati~nthat are
reminiscent of endemic lead colic. The Third Book of Epidemics (Chad 
wick and Mann, 1950, p. 66) refers to frequentdisord~rsof the belly:
"Painful colic and malignant flatulent colic also occurred; In these gOln.g to
stool did not relieve the pains, the stools being such that much remained
within the bowel after attempted evacuation. This conditi?nre~ponde?
only with difficulty to medicine, and in most casesp~rgatIvesdid addi 
tional harm. Many of those with this complaint penshed soon; others
lasted rather longer. "
The preceding excerpts show that Hippocrates(o~the authors of the
corpus that bears his name) was fully aware of the.van~ussyndromes now
regarded as being symptomatic of endemic lead pOISOnIng. However, there

Sympath~tic~athologi~alfeatures described in other ancient medical
texts haveh~ewI.sebeen mterpreted as plumbism. Spencer (1935) believed

physician) for colic contains saffron, anise, castory, 12 grms. each pars

behe~esthat such a mixture can assuage the pain of a lead colic and ha

~retaeusthe~appadocian(2.8) notes that there are many causes of
colic and that patIe?ts are speedily cut off by volvulus and tormina. Symp 
~o~s~edescnb~dI~cludetorpor, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, flatulence,
ISC una, and pams III the testicles and cremasters. These may be compli 
cated bya~scesses,~lcers,dropsies, and phthisis. Aretaeus (Chronic Dis 
eases, 2.6, -:tcutel?lseas~~,2.8) also described an unusual melancholic,
nervous colic that IS reminiscent of endemic lead colic: "The patients do
not sleep well a.nd waste away; the lower part of their abdomen is dry and
contracted;~th.mes,h~wever,they vomit material that is round, dry, and
black but as.If tmged WIth. yellow; there is almost no flow of urine, and the
hy~ochondnaare .filled WIth flatus; purgatives must be administered ener 
getIcally. for such I.llnesses.... Sometimes the disease becomes incurable;
when thisoc~urs,It engenders in the system a progeny of other diseases 
spasms, mama and paralysis. "
Pliny(26.6~regarded colic as one of the "new" endemic diseases attrib-
utable to the Increase of luxury in food and drink:
This itself is .a wonderful fact, that some diseases should disappear from
a~o~guswhI1~ot~ersremain endemic, as for example colic. It was in the
pnncipate ofTIbenu~Caesar that this malady made its way into Italy. No-
body suffered from It before the Emperor himself and th iti
1 ' e CI izens were
great y puzzled w?en they read in his edict, in which he begged to be ex 
cusedbecaus~of Illness, a name they had never heard before. What are we
to say tha.t this means, what wrath of the gods? Were the recognised kinds of
human disease, more than three hundred, too few, that they must be in-
384 Lead Exposure and Lead Poisoning
creased by new ones also to add to man's fears? No fewer either are the trou 
bles which man brings upon himself by his own agency.
Pundits may view Pliny's observation in relation to the widespread di 
etary exposure to lead in his days.
Galen also refers to pernicious colic and gives a long list of remedies for
it. They consist principally of narcotics such as opium, henbane, euphor 
bium, and mandragora, along with carminative aromatics, among others
(Adams, 1844-1847; Kobert, 1909). Alexander of Trailles (9.1) realizes the
difficulty in distinguishing colic from diseases located in the adjoining
parts. He first treats colic pain occasioned by cold humor, and recom 
mends such remedies as thinning food, including white wines in cases of
flatulence, the use of a sulfurous bath if convenient, purging with aloes,
scammony, and the like, administering clysters of hot oil, either alone or
with some carminative, giving narcotics, such as opium and henbane,
when the humors are thin and acrid but not otherwise, and sometimes giv 
ing emetics (see Adams, 1844-1847), When the colic is attended by consti 
pation, he suggests giving water, oil, and mead, or administering the same
in clysters. In obstinate cases he recommends inflating the bowels with bel 
lows and injecting afterward some niter and oil and water; he is not averse
to prescribing pills or pellets of lead.
The beginning of Caelius Aurelianus' (Chronic Diseases 4.7) chapter on
colic is lost. As additional symptoms, he notes "a feeling of heaviness,
thirst, loss of appetite, and during an attack or exacerbation of the disease,
cold numbness and leaden color of the limbs, sweating, dullness of the
mind, and a small, thick pulse. There are also hiccoughs, suppression of
bowel movements or else painful evacuation, difficulty of urination, heav 
iness of the head, and intestinal churning and rumbling (Greek borboryg 
mos). In the increasing phase of the disease the patient vomits thick fluids
(Greek phlegmata), then bilious matter. And there is distention of the
membrane, called peritonaeos, which is situated underneath the skin and
encloses the abdominal cavity. If this distention persists, the parts when
struck with the palm of the hand resound like a drum; this is due to the
puffing-up of the membrane. Again, there is abdominal swelling and much
rumbling; during the remission wind is passed noisily through the anus."
Paulus Aegineta (3.43) describes the pathological features of (lead?) colic:
"there is a sensation in the abdomen as if it were pierced by a wimble; they
are troubled with tormina, eructations, nausea, and vomitings of all kinds,
but more especially of phlegm. The belly is greatly constipated, so as not
to allow the passage of even wind; and any faeces which are discharged
seem like the dung of oxen, light and windy.... When the attack proceeds
from flatulence, there is rather a sense of distension. When it is from in 
flammation, there is a sense of heat in the part, and no inconsiderable fe 
ver, retention of the urine as well as the faeces, pulsation in the belly,
thirst, and troublesome heat, nausea, and vomitings, more especially of

bile, which afford no relief. In short, this is the most severe of the colic
affections, and threatens to pass into ileus. When acrid and sharp humours
are the cause of pain, the patients, as in the case of inflammation, have
heat, thirst, and sleeplessness...."
In the same chapter, Paulus Aegineta (3.43) described pandemic attacks
of colic followed by paralysis of the extremities and sometimes accom 
panied by epileptic-like seizures and death (see Major, 1945, p. 313):
I consider moreover a colicky affection, which still becomes violent from a
kind of collection of humors, which took its origin from regions in Italy,
moreover in many other places in Roman territory whence like the contagion
of a pestilential plague. Wherefore in many cases it passed into epilepsy, to
some there came loss of motion with sensation unhurt, to many both, and of
those who fell victims to the epilepsy, very many died. Of those indeed who
were paralysed, not a few recovered, for the cause which attacked them
ended by crisis.
The preceding is generally regarded as the first extant account of epidemic
lead poisoning (Baker, 1767; Tanquerel des Planches, 1839; Major, 1945).
Like Pliny (26.6) before him, Paulus claims the colic to be a relatively new
pandemic disease, but he says nothing of the possible antecedent causes.
It is clear, however, from the preceding section that colic was familiar to
many ancient doctors who presumably did not realize the pandemic nature
of the disease in their own time.
Caelius Aurelianus described a number of acute diseases, sometimes
caused by wines and luxurious dishes, which are very reminiscent of sat 
urine encephalopathy. Among such syndromes are seizure (catalepsis),
which is supervened by benumbed and blunted senses, ocular neuritis, per 
sistent failure to evacuate the stomach, abdominal distention with rumbling
of intestines, failure to draw back the limbs again after they have been
stretched out, or to stretch them out again after they have been contracted,
and so forth (Acute Diseases 2.10). Among the acute diseases associated
with intemperance, Aurelianus (Chr. Dis. 2.1) refers to paralysis with such
supervenient symptoms as the stiffness and numbness of the parts, pallor,
feeling of heaviness in the parts in question, atrophy, apoplexy, and cata 
lepsis. The association of these Aurelianian diseases with a life-style liable
to have been subjected to extensive dietary exposure to lead would impli 
cate lead as a possible etiological factor in the syndromes described. Even
the remedies prescribed would provide relief in cases of acute plumbism.
The most vivid description of lead poisoning really comes in the follow 
ing poem by an anonymous Greek or Roman hermit on the curse of intem 
perance (transl, by Humelbergius Secundus, 1829):
Hence gout and stone afflict the human race'
Hence lazy jaundice with her saffron face; ,
Palsy, with shaking head and tott'ring knees.
And bloated dropsy, the staunch sot's disease;
Consumption, pale, with keen but hollow eye, .
And sharpened feature, shew'd that death was nigh.
The feeble offspring curse their crazysire~,
And, tainted from his birth, the youth expires.
The author indeed mentions the principal warning symptoms of classic
lead poisoning.
Ingestion of Lead Compounds
As suggested before, lead was recognized as deadlypo~sonin prehistoric
ti The earliest extant work that describes the tOXIC effects of lead,
~::~~eris the Alexipharmaca by Nicander (or Nikander)-aseco~dce~&#173;
turyB.C~Greek poet, physician, and grammari.an. In histe~twntten Ill.
verse Nicander lists 22 poisons, including white lead an.d lI:harge. The
preci~eand detailed account of the symptoms of leadpo~~omngand~he
remedies recommended suggest that he was merely compiling orC~PYlllg
body of knowledge that was already considerable and probably quite old
~Allbutt,1921, p. 364; Stevenson, 1949).Stevenso~(l~49,p. 13) specutates
that Nicander based his description of acute pOlsOmng on an earlier blv
count in a nonextant book by Apollodorus (ca. 300 B.C.), who presuma Y
drew his information from much earlier sources... .
In the description of symptoms arising from thelllge~tl~nof white lead,

literation is from Major (1945, p. 312):

those suggested by Nicander.
Scr!bonius Largus (Composi:iones, pp. 183-184) added to the symptoms
of white-lead poisoning the whitening of both the tongue and the commis

takeso~a leaden hue. Finally, burning pains are felt in the articulations.
If the disease takes.~turn for the worse, paralysis of the extremities ap 
pears as well as delirium and convulsive trembling."
Paulus Aegineta (5.59) did not add anything really new, either to the
symptomology or treatment of white-lead poisoning:
Ceruse, owing to its colour, cannot be mistaken, and when taken voluntarily
it whitens the palate, tongue, and the intervals between the teeth. It also
brings on hiccup and cough, dryness of the tongue, and coldness of the ex 
tremities, with disorder of the intellect and difficulty of moving. In this case
it will be proper to give honied water or the decoction of figs, or of mallows,
or hot milk, or sesame triturated with wine, or the lye of vine shoots, or the
oil of marjoram, or iris; also the bones of peaches, with a decoction of barley
or frankincense, or the gum of prunes, or the juice of the elm which is con 
tained in its follicles, along with tepid water; but let them immediately vomit.
The juice of thapsia will also be proper for them, or three oboli of the juice
of scammony, when drunk with honied water.
Celsus (5.27) certainly knew of the toxicity of white lead, for he precribed
"mallow or walnut juice rubbed up in wine" as an antidote to white-lead
poisoning.
Nicander (Alexipharmaca, n. 595-611) also describes the intoxication
symptoms induced by swallowing litharge as borborygmi, violent colic, re 
tention of urine, swollen limbs, and leaden discoloration of the skin. His
remedies include warm stimulants, diuretics, and carminatives:
Also do not neglect litharge, which brings suffering when its hateful burden
sinks into the stomach and wind circulates and rumbles about the mid navel,
as in a violent colic which overpowers men, smiting them with sudden pains.
The victim's flow of urine fails; then the limbs swell and the skin has the ap 
pearance of lead.
Give the patient either a double obol's weight of myrrh or a fresh infusion of
sage, or else cut him hypericum from the hills, or sprigs of hyssop, or again
a spray of the wild fig and seed of celery from the Isthmus. Or else you
should roast pepper along with rue and grate them into wine, and so rescue
him from deadly sickness. You should also give fresh buds of henna, or the
firstling fruit of the pomegranate with the flower still upon it.
Additional signs of litharge poisoning adduced by Scribonius Largus in 
clude a sensation of weight, inflammation and pain in the stomach, a
marked leaden hue in the face, and suppuration of many parts. As reme 
dies, he recommends emetics and calefacient medicines such as pepper,
myrrh, and parsley. Paulus Aegineta (5.61) merely articulates the well 
known pathological features of litharge poisoning in the following passage:
"Litharge, when drunk, brings on heaviness of the stomach and bowels,
with intense tormina; sometimes by its weight it wounds the intestines, oc 
casions retention of urine and swelling of the body, which becomes of a
leaden hue, and assumes an unseemly appearance. In such cases it will be
proper, after vomiting, to give the seed of the wild clary (horminum) to
drink with wine, three oboli of myrrh, wormwood, parsleyseed, pepper,
the flower of privet with wine, and the dried dung of wild pigeons, with
nard and wine."

<p>390 Lead Exposure and Lead Poisoning
I &#8226; &#8226;
Ancient Descriptions of Lead Polsomng
391
Paulus Aegineta (5.62) also states that the shavings of lead or its soils
induce the same symptoms as those from litharge, and that it is to be
treated in the same manner. Furthermore, the very close similarity be 
tween the pathological features of mercury and litharge poisoning is noted
by Paulus (5.63), who adds that a copious draught of milk seems to be ben 
eficial, and that vomiting ought to be encouraged.
When the writings of the ancient physicians-from Nicander to Paulus 
are compared, it appears that the authors drew upon wide experience that
was supported by a body of knowledge that had existed for centuries.
None of the ancient authorities dealt with the prognosis and sequelae of
lead poisoning. Furthermore, the circumstances surrounding the ingestion
of lead salts-whether accidental, suicidal, or homicidal-are not re 
corded. There is a noticeable divergence of opinion in the speculative the 
ories about the pathology and treatment of lead poisoning, depending on
the school to which the practitioner belonged and personal conviction. The
available literary records generally evince common sense in the treatment
of patients known to have swallowed lead. The descriptions of lead toxicity
within the framework of occupational or other exposures given, for exam 
ple, by Pliny (14.22, 34.41, 34.50) and Vitruvius (8.3, 8.6) have already
been referred to.
The ancient literary sources thus clearly show an important dichotomy
in their apprehension of lead poisoning. On the one hand, there was the
precise understanding of the toxic effects of ingesting lead or its salts. On
the other hand, we have the documentation and diagnosis of a mysterious
disorder with pathognomonic features reminiscent of plumbism, but it was
apparently not associated with lead in the minds of the ancient clinicians.
This failure to diagnose lead as the causative factor of the mysterious and
often vague syndrome is believed to have caused much human suffering
even in modern times, and also to have been particularly inauspicious fo;
aristocrats in the Roman Empire.
Accounts in Ancient Indian and Chinese Texts
Lead poisoning was rarely described as a unique disease in the ancient In 
dian works extant. However, the premonitory symptoms given for an elixir
or metallic poisoning sometimes are fairly identical to those of plumbism.
In other words, plumbism was likely to have been properly diagnosed and
treated as "metallic poisoning" without actually implicating lead as the
etiological factor.
The Sanskrit text Sushruta listed white arsenic and yellow orphiment as
~hetwo mineral poisons, and it excluded the lead salts. Nevertheless, there
IS a very close resemblance between the syndrome of acute plumbism and
the following premonitory symptoms of the weak and slow mineral poisons
(Dushi-Visha). " ... heaviness of the limbs,y~wning,a sense of looseness
(in the joints), horripilation andachin~o~the.lImbs ..Th~seare followed by

bowels (Anahara), others, by an involuntaryemlss~o~ofs.emen,~hdea
few others produce confused speech, or some other similar disease (Sush 
ruta Samhita: Kalpa Sthanam, ch. 2). The sequelae given for Sthavara
(mineral or vegetable) poisoning areals~interesting,i~the sense that most
of the symptomatological features mentioned are mamfested by acute lead
poisoning:
The second stage is marked by such syrnptons as shivering,perspir~t!on,
burning sensation, itching and pain in the body; when seat.ed 10 the ,Amasaya
(stomach) it causes pain in the region of the heart. The third stage IS marked
by a dryness of the palate and severe (colic) pain in thest~mach.The,~yes

while the seventh stage is marked by a breaking pam 10 the back, the shoul

The treatments recommended for Sthavara poisoning includet~ei~medi&#173;

Lead Exposure and Lead Poisoning
Ancient Descriptions of Lead Poisoning 393
the elixir preparations since very early times. One of the earliest cases of
elixir poisoning was a certain SUi-the personal physician to the prince
of Chhi (ca. 216-150 B.C.) who ingested his own preparations containing
the five minerals and died of ulcers (chu) in the chest after 100 days (Ho
Ping-Yii and Needham, 1970). The Chin emperor Ai Ti (reigned: 361-366
A.D.) "abstained from cereal grains, but consumed elixirs. As a result of
an overdose, he was poisoned and no longer knew, what was going on
around him" (Ho Ping-Yu and Needham, 1970). Other examples are given
in the paper by Ho Ping-Yii and Needham (1970), and also in other works
by Needham (1974, 1976). The strongest warning against the toxicity of
elixir preparations is the following excerpt from a much later work-the
Pen Tshao Yen I [The meaning of the pharmacopoeia elucidated], which
was probably written around 1100-1119 A.D. by Khou Tsung:
Although there are medical recipes that include mercury, great care should
exercised because of its toxic effects. For a woman an overdose causes ste 
rility. Nowadays people often use it for treating convulsion, fever, and in 
creasing the flow of saliva (ching je hsien chhao) in children. Not a word
about these uses can be found in the (Shen Nung Pen Tshao) Ching (written
around first century B.C.). Hence the matter requires further elucidation.
(Mercury when) mixed with lead forms an amalgam (ning; lit. coagulates). It
has an affinity for (chieh; lit. ties with) sulphur (forming mercuric sulphide).
It breaks up (san; lit. disperses) when ground together with the fleshy part of
a date. In one of its applications it can be heated to form face powder (ni
fen). Calomel (fen shuang) ground with saliva can be used for killing fleas.
Copper brightens when (mercury) is applied to it. If poured into a corpse
mercury will delay putrefaction. Gold, silver, copper and iron will float when
placed on mercury. With lead (tzu ho chhe) mercury is subdued (fu).
Han Yu of the Thang (period) said: "Li Chhien, a Professor of the Imperial
Academy (Thai Hsiieh Po Shih), met the alchemist Lui Pi, a man from Hsin 
an, who could heat mercury and convert it into an elixir. The method con 
sisted of filling a reaction-vessel (ting) with lead, leaving some space at the
centre for the introduction of mercury, and when the cover was replaced and
sealed all-round, the contents were heated to form lead amalgam. After tak 
ing (the elixir) (Li Chhien) passed blood in urine and faeces, and after four
years he got worse and died. I do not know exactly when the teaching about
elixirs first began. (Although) it has resulted in countless deaths among peo 
ple, yet the art is still admired and sought after even today. (Many instances
of) such delusion have already been recorded in the literature. Without quot 
ing from hearsay evidence I shall now refer to six or seven persons known to
me personally who came to grief after taking elixirs. I witnessed these things
myself and set them forth here to serve as a public warning...."
"These (examples) should (be sufficient) to serve as warnings. Is it wise to
try to avoid death in such a way as to hasten one's death instead? The five
cereals, the three kinds of animals used for offerings (san sheng, i.e., fowls,
fish and pigs), salt, vinegar, fruits and vegetables are the things that men nor 
mally eat; they constitute the essential foods which give us strength. Now
misguided people clamour that the five cereals shorten human life and should
be eaten as little as possible. They only feel sorry for themselves when death
is approaching. How regrettable this is!"
Nowadays there are people who roast mercury into cinnabar, but without
being aware of (the poison) some physicians use (the cinnabar) for coating
medicines or as ingredients of prescriptions. Is not this a great mistake and
can we ever be off our guard?" (Transl. by Ho Ping-Yu and Needham, 1970,
p. 323)
The awareness of elixir toxicity by the ancient Chinese adepts is further
attested to by attempts at toxicological experimentation by Wei Po-Yang
(a second century A.D. adept), using white dogs, and by Thopa Kuei (ca.
400 A.D.), using condemned criminals. Chhen Shao-Wei-a Thang alchem 
ist-stresses that lead, silver, copper, tin, gold, and iron are all poisonous.
In the Chen Yuan Miao Tao Liien [Classified essentials of the mysterious
Tao of the true origin of things], which contains material dating back to
about the fourth century A.D., the putative author Cheng Ssu-Yuan gives
case histories of people who died from ingesting elixirs made from lead,
mercury, cinnabar (usually a lead-mercury amalgam), and silver. He also
cites people who became seriously ill through drinking "liquid lead" made
by heating "black lead" (see Ho Ping-Yu and Needham, 1970).
There was, however, a different school of alchemists who totally ig 
nored the health risks from metallic elixirs, and who even considered the
toxicity syndrome, following the taking of the preparations, to be quite
normal and propitious. One striking passage to this effect comes from the
Thai-Chhing Shih Pi Chi [Records in the rock Chamber: a Thai-Chhing
scripture]-an early sixth century A.D. text, but with some material dating
back to the third century: "After taking the elixir one feels an itch all over
the body and the face, rather like having the sensation of insects crawling
over one. The body, the face, the hands and legs may become swollen.
One may experience a feeling of repulsion at the sight of food, and vomit 
ing usually follows after a meal. One feels rather weak in the four limbs.
Other symptoms include frequent defaecation, vomiting, headache and
pains in the abdomen. No alarm should be caused by these effects, because
they are due to the work of the elixir in dispelling all the inherent disorders
(in the human body)" (Ho Ping-Yu and Needham, 1970, p. 331).
From the preceding account, it is clear that the ancient Chinese adepts
and doctors were familiar with the many symptoms of lead, and other me 
tallic, poisoning. The premonitory symptoms of elixir poisoning given in
the preceding literary sources include loss of appetite, headaches, oedema,
weakness of the extremeties, severe abdominal colic, cramps, vomiting,
nausea, formication, muscular tremor, or paralysis, and severe impairment
of mental faculties. Whether lead poisoning per se was recognized as a
unique disease is not clear from these sources.
Considerable effort was nevertheless devoted to developing mitigative
measures against elixir poisoning: "The five metals and the three lung
(mercuries) together with the nine chhien (leads) and the eight minerals are

</div1>
<div1 id="page_44" n="44" type="page">

Lead Exposure and Lead Poisoning
Ancient Descriptions of Lead Poisoning 395
all poisonous. Without procuring the original formulae of the ancient (mas 
ters) any attempt to use newly acquired recipes described verbally in a few
words is doomed to failure. Hence Hu (Kang) Tzu says, 'the five metals
have to be purified from all poisons caused by heating. Ifthey are not prop 
erly treated the poison will turn to a powder form, and if (the ingredients)
are used for making elixirs without having their poison removed, and in 
gested for any length of time, death will be caused when the rules are not
followed.' " The preceding excerpt is from the Huang Ti Chiu Ting
Shen Tan Ching Chueh [Explanation of the Yellow Emperor's manual of
the nine-vessel magical elixir]-a large tract of Thang or Early Sung vin 
tage that includes material dating back to the second century A.D. (Ho
Ping-ve and Needham, 1970).
According to this text, the method used by the ancients to render the
lead harmless was to "heat it in vinegar together with red salt and cinne 
bar. " Several ancient texts endeavored to neutralize the elixir toxicity by
the proper blending of the yin and yang ingredients, according to the the 
ory of categories. Others recommended potent herbal mixtures that could
serve both as an elixir and as an antidote for ordinary elixir poisoning. The
necessity of building up one's constitution before embarking on the elixir
diet is stressed in the Chen Chung Chi [Records of the pillow-book], attrib 
uted to the legendry Sun Ssu-Mo who died ca. 682 A.D.: "One must take
vegetable and plant drugs at first until their beneficial effects are felt; then
only can one take mineral drugs for the purpose of achieving longevity"
(Needham, 1976, p. 135). The techniques for "killing" the metals are typ 
ically encountered in the Indian alchemical texts, and they serve basically
the same objective. The more traditional detoxifying treatments were of
course, also employed. A good example of this comes from the Thai 
Chhing Shih Pi Chi that has been referred to previously:
When the elixir takes effect one should immediately bathe oneself with hot
and cold water and take a mixture of scallion, soya-bean sauce and wine.
The same cure is to be recommended (for relieving the after-effects of) hsiin
huang (a dark variety of realgar). If relief does not come, then a hornet's nest
(lu feng fang), some Euphorbia sieboldiana (kan sui), some Solomon's Seal
(Polygonatum officinale) (wei jui) and some Ephedra sinica (rna huang) may
be separately extracted with boiling water and combined for use as a medi 
cine. One dose is sufficient to bring relief.
Such a therapy may be compared with the treatments administered by the
Greco-Roman doctors, which were discussed before.
Saturnine Gout among the Aristocrats of the Roman Empire
The pathogenesis of saturnine gout is of great interest in terms of possible
pandemic lead poisoning in ancient times. Unlike the syndrome for plum 
bism, the symptoms for gout in its acute and chronic forms and associated
lithiasis have been familiar to physicians and the common people since re 
mote antiquity. Furthermore, the history of gout has been a more fertile
field for study, and the wealth of information garnered can shed some light
on the catenated incidence of lead poisoning. Any reader interested in the
history of gout should consult, for example, the following authors: Garrod
(1876), Duckworth (1889), Delpeuch (1900), Schnitker (1936), Ludwig
(1957), Bywaters (1962), Rodnan and Benedek (1963), Copeland (1964),
Mertz (1971), Talbott and Yu (1976), and de Vries (1976). A succinct re 
view of saturnine gout has been presented by Wyngaarden and Kelley
(1976).
Although Musgrave (1723) is generally credited with the first report of
coexistent gout and plumbism, it was Sir Alfred B. Garrod (1859) who
clearly demonstrated the high incidence of plumbism in gouty subjects and
adduced a causal relationship. Garrod (1859, 1876) reported that roughly
25-33% of his gouty patients were plumbers and painters who had acquired
their plumbism from occupational exposure. Studies in many countries
have confirmed Garrod's observations, and the literature of the latter half
of the nineteenth century is particularly voluminous with case reports and
controversies regarding whether or not the lead acted in a secondary 
excitant or primary-causal manner (see Ludwig, 1957).
Ball (1971) has inferred that the epidemic of gout among the British gen 
try of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries resulted from the consump 
tion of prodigious amounts of wine contaminated with lead. In another im 
portant study, Ball and Sorensen (1969) found that 37 of their 43 patients
acquired saturnine gout from prolonged exposure to the relatively small
amounts of lead in the illicit alcoholic drink called "moonshine." Appar 
ently, the damaged tubules cause the retention of uric acid, which many
clinicians believe is responsible for gout (Wyngaarden and Kelley, 1976;
Wessel and Dominski, 1977). Did gout also stigmatize "the noblemen of
fashion and wasted fortune" of the Roman Empire who had a similar bac 
chanalian disposition?
Before considering the incidence of gout in ancient times, it should be
noted that the term "gout" was only introduced into the medical literature
during the thirteenth century by the famous French historian Geoffroi de
Villehardouin (Neuwirth, 1943; Hartung, 1957). The Greek and Roman au 
thors used the equivalent term podagra-a cognomen for an affection of
the joints of beasts of burden (Skinner, 1949). Later, classical authors also
used other terms for pains or seisures in other joints of the body, such as
chiragra for the hand, gonagra for the knee, pechyagra for the elbow, den 
tagra for the teeth, cleisagra for the clavicle, omagra for the shoulder,
rachisagra for the spine, and sciatica for an involvement of the hip (Cae 
lius Aurelianus Chronic Diseases 5.2; Schnitker, 1936). In these various
guises, gout may be regarded as one of the most common diseases in clas 
sical times.
The Hippocratic corpus is generally credited with the earliest clinical
</p>
</div1>

<p>396 Lead Exposure and Lead Poisoning
Ancient Descriptions of Lead Poisoning
397
description of podagra. The corpus recognized that rich foods and wines
had something to do with its cause, that there was a rich-man's gout and a
poor-man's gout, that eunuchs were hardly ever affected by it, and that its
onset only occurred after puberty in young men and after the menopause
in women (Aphorisms 6.28-30; Prognostics ch. 15). The consumption of
fermented beverages was no longer considered a taboo in these two age
groups. Hippocrates believed in the value of the diet in management, and
he administered purgatives by the mouth or by injection, noting that "the
best natural relief of this disease is an attack of dysentery. " Severe colic
and constipation are also indicative of acute lead poisoning. These views
were widely espoused by ancient and medieval doctors throughout the
Western world.
Seneca (Epistle 95) regarded gout as a monstrous example of the de 
pravity of his age-that the women, by their luxurious habits, had become
subject to gout. It is significant that the prohibition against bibulous wives
was relaxed in the late Republic times (Balsdon, 1962, p. 213). It became
a topic of much satire and ridicule by the literati of the Roman Empire 
Virgil, Martial, Athenaeus, Juvenal, Ovid, and Musonius commented on
gout in their writings. Such a posting suggests that it must have been a very
common disease then. Pliny (Natural History 26.64) remarked that podagra
&#8226;'was a rarer disease within the memory, not only of our fathers and grand 
fathers, but also of our own generation. It is also itself a foreign complaint;
had it existed in Italy in early times it would have received a Latin name.
It must not be considered incurable, for many cases have been cured with 
out treatment, and yet more with it." The large number of remedies sub 
sequently recommended and Pliny's frequent allusions to podagra also sug 
gest that this disease had become a matter of common concern.
Celsus (De medicina 4.24) stressed the value of regular exercises and
the avoidance of obesity in the management of podagra, and he observed
that most of the Roman emperors suffered from gout. The excruciating
pains from recurring bouts of acute gout eventually led the consul Agrippa
to commit suicide (see Talbott and Yu, 1976). Galen (De medicina: Com 
mentary on Hippocratic Aphorisms) added that venery was also a cause of
gout and is reputed to have coined the aphorism "podagra is the daughter
of Bacchus and Venus" (Schnitker, 1936). Arataeus (Extant Works 2.12)
reported a higher incidence of gout in males, and he postulated that the
cause of gout was a toxic substance-a pecant humour-rather than the
accumulation of natural humors that was espoused by Hippocrates, Galen,
and others. He is credited with the first use of hellebore, a mild purge, in
gout pharmacognosy, and he clearly recognized the intermittent nature of
the disease. Psellus (Opus medicum, cited in Adams, 1844, p. 668) believed
that gout was occasioned by an atony of the nutritive faculty that engen 
dered the collection of a thick humor in the system.
Caelius Aurelianus (Chronic Diseases 5.2) reiterates that intemperance,
indigestion, and debauchery are the usual precursory causes of gout, and
he describes the disease as a "sensation as if ants are crawling over the
part." He reported a prevalence of gout in Cairo and Alexandria, even
though podagra is reputed to be uncommon in the economically deprived,
non-wine-producing tropics. He reviews the well-known supervenient
symptoms that certainly elicit some comparison with plumbism: numbness
of joints, difficulty in movement, feeling of heaviness, intense heat or cold,
sleeplessness, severe distress, constipation, and so forth. He strongly fa 
vors a sparse diet in treatment. Alexander of Tralles (Works, ch. 11) is fa 
mous for introducing colchicum (hermodactyl) into the management of
gout. He also realized the seasonal and intermittent character of the dis 
ease, and he devised a "cyclic treatment" based on the regulation of diet,
catharsis, and abstinence from liquor and dainty dishes. He lists some 40
prescriptions for the treatment of gout-some containing as many as 30 in-.
gredients. Paulus Aegineta (Seven Books ofPaulus Aegineta 3.78) outdid
Alexander in listing over 70 prescriptions for the disease. The variety of
remedial measures employed by these Byzantine doctors suggests that
gout continued to remain a very common endemic disease.
Soranus of Ephesus, Serenus Samonius, Scribonius Largus, Aetius, Ori 
basius, Actuarius, Nonnus, and Octavius Horatianus also left a fine heri 
tage on the subject of gout (see Adams, 1844, p. 667). Particularly note 
worthy in the ancient annals on gout is the tragicomic poem entitled
"Tragopodagra," which is usually attributed to the famous Lucian. It is a
witty ridicule of the many pretended nostrums for this particular ailment:
from hands and feets extremitys
th' impetuous fiery ichor flyes;
a furious spirit thro~every vein.
rushes with unrelentive pain.
whilst every member, as it come,
th' encaustic pestilence consumes
as the rock Aetna's furnace burns,
and marble into pumice turns:
so by thy chemistry we find
our bones and joints to chalk calcin'd;
or knotty made and motionless
o who can thy dire dills express!
LUCIAN
The pestilential nature of gout in those days is recorded in the poem.
The profusion of the ancient literary records clearly suggests that poda 
gra was a pandemic disease, particularly during the Roman Empire. How
much of this was of the saturnine variety? Running thematically through
the ancient annals on gout is the relationship between this disease and the
consumption of dainty dishes and alcoholic beverages. In summarizing the
</p>

399
ancient precepts of clinical gout, Garrod (1876) remarked that "no truth in
medicine is better established than the fact that the use of fe;mented li 
quors is the most powerful of all the predisposing causes of gout." He then
wondered "whether gout would have been known to mankind had such
beverages not been used." Morris Longstreth (1882) shared the same view:
"Screw up the vice as tightly as possible, you had rheumatism; unscrew it
and there was gout." Of all the likely constituents in ancient wines, lead 
in fact-is the one that most actively potentiates gout, particularly during
continuous exposure (see Ball, 1971).
The bibulous enthusiasm of the Romans is certainly legendry. Pliny
(14.29) estimates that there were at least 185 brands of wines in his time
and double that number if one counted the varieties. Athenaeus knew of 85
.brands of wines, Galen enumerated 60, and Strabo 30 (Forbes, 1965). The
average annual consumption of wines in ancient Rome has been estimated
to be about 1 to 5 lIday-l/person (based on data from Loane, 1938; Frank,
1959; Forbes, 1965). On special days, however, immense quantities were
consumed. For example, Lucullus needed about 4 million liters for his
triumphal banquet (Loane, 1938). The drunkenness of the Roman aristo 
crats is certainly well known and need not be pursued here. In terms of
their bibulous habits, there is thus a commonality between the noble
"gouty" of eighteenth- or nineteenth-century Britain (Bywaters, 1962;
Ball, 1971) and the aristocrats of the Roman Empire. The analogy is even
more profound: The two privileged classes assuaged their prodigious thirst
with wines believed to be contaminated with goutogenic lead.
The proscription of dainty dishes was another strategy in gout manage 
ment used by many ancient doctors previously mentioned. The efficacy of
such a treatment becomes comprehensible with the realization that most of
these dishes were particularly liable to be contaminated with "goutogenic"
lead. The often mentioned seasonal and intermittent nature of the gouty
attacks also fits the well-known symptoms of plumbism (Chisolm, 1971;
Wessel, 1977).
The English gentry of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries also in 
gested much lead from dietary sources-a fact ignored by Ball (1971). In
addition to contamination from lead pipes as well as pewter pots and pans,
the spices and sauces used in their dainty dishes, their confectioneries, and
their tobacco were often adulterated with lead (see, for example, Robert 
son, 1781; Accum, 1820; Filby, 1934). Here again we see a common thread
in the life-styles of the gouty English nobility and the aristocratic Ro 
mans-they were liable to have acquired unhealthy quantities of lead from
their voracious appetites.
Credence for the hypothesis that saturnine gout was pandemic among
the aristocrats of the Roman Empire comes in the form of an actual eye 
witness account. Musonium (ca. 20-90 A.D.), in fact, has left us the follow 
ing perceptive account of coexistent gout and plumbism among the aristo 
crats (i.e., the "masters") of his time who lived on prepared dainties:
That masters are less strong, less healthy, less able to endure labour than
servants; countrymen more strong than those who are bred in the city, those
that feed meanly than those who feed daintily; and that, generally, the latter
live longer than the former. Nor are there any other persons more troubled
with gouts, dropsies, colics, and the like, than those who, condemning sim 
ple diet, live upon prepared dainties. (Transliteration by Humelbergius Se 
cundus, 1829)
Crediting Musgrave (1723) with the "discovery" of saturnine gout seems
to have been misplaced. A recent study of the skeletal remains from Cori 
nium Dobunnorum (Cirencester, Gloucestershire) indeed confirm a high in 
cidence of gout among the Roman-age inhabitants (Toronto Globe and
Mail, Dec. 13, 1982, p. 14) .
LEAD POISONING AND THE DECLINE OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE
Seutonius (The Twelve Caesars 3.4) claimed that the decline of the Roman
Empire was a result of apathy and gluttony. Cicero (106-43 B.C.) shared a
similar prudent foresight in his tacit comment that "the mouth claims more
victims than the sword." Modern research now seems to bear out their
serendipitous claims, but in a rather different sense.
During the past 500 years or so, several authors have suggested that the
general contamination of food and drink with lead-particularly during the
Roman Empire-would have resulted in the widespread incidence of
plumbism. The venerable Sir George Baker (1767, p. 270) perceptively ob 
served: "It will hardly be doubted, but that the juice of the grape, thus
evaporated in leaden vessels, must have dissolved some of the metal; and
it should seem that the wine, manufactured in the manner above described,
must have been prejudicial to those who drank it, in proportion to the
quantity of defrutum or sapa mixed with it." Sir Edward Barry (1775),
Henderson (1824), Beckmann (I846)-all referred to the fact that contami 
nation of Roman wines with lead would have been inimical to the health of
the many imbibers. Hofmann (1883, 1885) and Kobert (1909) argue perspi 
caciously that lead poisoning was pandemic during the Roman Empire. In
a classic paper, Gilfillan (1965) propounded the thesis that lead poisoning
was the major factor in the Fall of Rome.
In the preceding sections, an attempt has been made to document the
widespread contamination of Romano-Greek food and drink with lead, and
to show that lead poisoning was a pandemic disease during the Roman Em 
pire. On the basis of the available information, estimates of the lead in 
takes by an aristocrat, a plebian, and a slave during the times of the Roman
Empire have been made (see Table 6.3). The suggestion is made that wine
consumption generally accounted for 50-60% of the daily intake of all three
population groups. The Roman predilection for wines is well known. Ath 
enaeus (1.47), for instance, noted that wine is excellent for health, that it

Table 6.3 Exposure of the Subpopulations of the Roman Empire to Lead
-Unless noted otherwise, these absorption values, which are for present-day adults,
are taken from the NAS Report (1980).
-Minor amounts of airborne lead probably derived from domestic combustion of
wood. The pulmonary ventilation rate (20 mvday),
-Water pipes to the aristocratic village commonly made of lead; hence the high Pb
concentration. High incidence of enophic intake would have reduced the water
consumption.
"These estimates are rather conservative. It is assumed that the average Pb content
of confusum wines was 10 mg/liter (less than the value found by Hofmann [1883],
or expected from the recipes given by Columella [12.19-21]), and that such
blended wines were consumed 5-30% of the time. Most of the lead in the wines
would have been bound to organic ligands and hence more readily absorbed
through the gastrointestinal tract; the absorption factor for lead in wines is un 
known, however.
eThe voracious Roman gentry in all likelihood consumed more than 3 kg of food
per day. Most of the lead in their entrees probably came from the use of sapa as a
sweetner or a preservative.
/The aristocrats frequently took emetics and antidotes (against surreptitious poi 
sons) which were at times adulterated with lead.
-The plebians generally got their water from public water supplies usually with little
or no lead plumbing.
is the best thing to dissolve food, that it strengthens, that it assists the cir 
culation of the blood and assures a peaceful sleep. Even Cato (arts. 56-58),
a hard and thrifty man, recommended nearly 750 ml of lora ("afterwine")
a day for each member of the chain gang. And wines were easily affordable
in those days! In Rome, the price of common wine, oftentimes adulterated,
was only 15 sesterces for an amphora (Columella 3.3), or less than 20 cents
per gallon. In Athens, the same measure sold for no more than 5 sesterces
(Seyer, 1853).
The daily intake of lead by the aristocratic class is clearly remarkable.
The present estimate puts the amount of lead absorbed daily by an average
aristocrat to range from 155 to 1500 /-Lg, with a mean of about 250 J.tg (Table
6.3). The daily doses of lead absorbed by the hoi polloi and a slave field 
hand have been estimated to be 35 J-Lg (range: 35-320 u.g) and 20 ug (range:
20--97 J.1g), respectively (see Table 6.3). These figures may be compared
with the 30--50 ug/day absorbed by the present-day adult American (NAS,
1980; Drill et al., 1979). The current dietary intake of lead in the United
Kingdom is 55-366 u.g/day, with a mean of 113 ug/day (DHSS, 1980). These
values translate roughly into 6-37 ug/day of lead absorbed. Estimates from
various countries suggest that the lead intake from dietary sources typi 
cally is 200--300 ug/day. The tolerable dietary intake of lead recommended
by the World Health Organization (WHO, 1977) is only 430 J-Lg/day.1'
roughly equivalent to 43 J.tg of lead absorbed per day. By contrast, the av 
erage lead absorption in a pretechnological society has been estimated at
only 2.4 ug/day (NAS, 1980).
Even if the estimates of lead intake by the Roman aristocrats are off by
a factor of 2-5, there is still a strong suggestion that a large fraction of this
population group obtained enough lead from their food and drink to be con 
sidered at risk with regard to lead poisoning. Chamberlain and colleagues
hThe plebians probably drank a lot of the low-grade wines''doctored" by means of
sapa or defrutum. They were also liable to have had a drink or so in one of the
caupona, hospitium, popina, taberna, and thermopolium (neighborhood bars,
cafes, restaurants, etc.) where the wines were more liable to have been doctored
or mulled in leaden kettles. The daily consumption rate of only 1.0 liter is
conservative.
iMost of the lead in the plebian foods presumably came from pewter utensils and
as a contaminant in the condiments.
-The slaves presumably got their water from the lead-lined conduits to their mas 
ter's villae.
-Marcus Cato (Articles 56-58) left us with a good account of dietary rations for the
field hands. He recommends 4 lb of bread through the winter, increasing to 5 Ib
when they begin to work the vines and dropping back to 4 lb when the figs ripen.
He recommends about 750 ml of the afterwine (grape skins soaked in water) per
day. Lead contamination of such simple diets is expected to be minimal.
'Most of the exposure would have been occupationally related; that is, from work 
ing with lead or its compounds.

<p>402 Lead Exposure and Lead Poisoning
Lead Poisoning and the Decline of the Roman Empire 403
(1978) have shown that the intake of 100 ug/day of lead in the diet would
elevate the blood's lead concentration by 3.6 (range: 1.4-4.3) ug/dl. The
transfer rate for lead in water has been estimated by Berlin and associates
(1977) to be 1.8 (range: 0.7-3.4) ug/dl blood lead per 100 ug/liter water lead
ingested. We can assume that the mean figures are also applicable to the
transfer of dietary and enophic lead ingested by the Romans. Using the
data in Table 6.3, the lead concentration in the blood of the aristocrats is
estimated to be 50 jJv/dl, with a range of 18 to over 300 ug/dl. In terms of
the health effects of such lead burdens, it should be noted that an adult's
lead concentration in the blood of 30-40 ug/dl can cause chromosomal ab 
normalities, reduce fertility in women, alter spermatogenesis in men, and
increase the incidence of stillbirths and preterm deliveries (Beckman, 1978;
Fahim et al., 1975; Jaworski, 1979; OSHA, 1978). On the other hand, lead
concentration in adult blood of 40-60 jJvg/dl have been known to cause ane 
mia, peripheral neuropathy, psychological, sensory, and behavioral changes,
and to impair kidney function (Waldron and Stofen, 1974; WHO, 1977;
OSHA, 1978; EPA, 1979).The estimate presented here (of 50 ug/dl average)
suggests that the lead level in the blood of a typical Roman Empire aris 
tocrat puts him or her clearly above the threshold limit for the onset of
plumbism. Furthermore, lead, which is a classic example of a "race" poi 
son (see Hamilton, 1925), would have been passed on to his or her
offspring.
There is no denying that there are wide individual variations in the re 
tention of lead, and in the susceptibility to lead poisoning. Furthermore,
there were many absteminous aristocrats who lived during the time of the
Roman Empire. The estimate clearly pertains to the many aristocrats with
voracious appetites for blended wines and dainty dishes. It is documented
later that two thirds of all the emperors and usurpers who reigned between
35 B.C. and 220 A.D. fit this mold and would have been susceptible to lead
poisoning. If the satirical and humorous literary men are to be believed, a
comparable fraction of the entire aristocracy would seem to have been sim 
ilarly disposed to ingesting large quantities of lead-tainted Apician entrees
and Columellan wine blends.
The calculated daily exposure rates are fairly consistent with what has
been said in preceding paragraphs regarding the prevalence of plumbism in
the aristocratic class. The accounts by Pliny, Lucian, Musonius, and Pau 
lus Aegineta about widespread syndromes believed to be lead poisoning
have already been described. The evidence for an epidemic of saturnine
gout among the Roman nobility has also been presented. Thus, the literary
and archaeological evidence on aristocratic lifestyles in Rome leaves little
doubt that a large percentage of the Roman gentry was highly likely to con 
tract lead poisoning. Within the framework of modern toxicological results,
the suspected daily intake of lead would certainly have impaired the health
of the exposed population.
Evidence for overexposure to lead has been sought in the bony remains
of the Romans. Since 80-90% or more of the body burden of lead is stored
and fixed in the bones (see Barry, 1978), the measurement of the lead con 
tents of archaeological skeletal samples can thus be used as an index of the
total lead absorption, or the exposure of the individual to lead. Indeed, the
available data indicate rather clearly that the lead contents of present-day,
urban North American populations receiving elevated lead exposure from
environmental sources exceed those of pretechnological populations by
1-3 orders of magnitude (see Grandjean, 1978; Ericson et aI., 1979; NAS,
1980). Factors that contribute to the eccentricities in the lead contents of
archaeological bone specimens have been detailed in several reports (e.g.,
Grandjean, 1975;Waldron and Wells, 1979; Waldron et al., 1979), and need
not be repeated here.
In a pioneering effort that was unfortunately hindered by the analytical
inadequacies of his day, Rosenblatt analyzed 22 ancient bones from var 
ious sites. He found lead only in the four samples from Carthage-two
from before the Roman conquest of the city and two from after the con 
quest (Kobert, 1909). The lead concentrations could not even be quanti 
fied, and the tantalizing results are of but limited significance. On the basis
of apparently nonexistent results, Gilfillan (1965) claimed that there was a
marked difference in the lead contents of poor Romans vis-a-vis the rich
during the Empire period. The claim, based on the unclassified bones of 40
persons, was nevertheless used to buttress his hypothesis that chronic lead
poisoning was responsible for the Fall of Rome.
By far, the most comprehensive and detailed work on the use of bones
to assess historical exposures to lead has been done by H. A. Waldron and
his colleagues (see Waldron et al., 1976; Mackie et aI., 1975; Waldron and
Wells, 1979). Some of their results from British bone specimens are sum 
marized in Table 6.4. They found that samples from the pre-Roman sites
at Bath and Danebury had the lowest lead concentrations. The people who
lived in the Romanized town of Cirencester experienced considerably
greater exposure to lead as compared to the inhabitants of other contem 
porary sites (see Table 6.4). The evidence of a bimodal distribution at Cir 
encester perhaps is related to the difference in the exposure rates of. the
affluent subgroup, as compared to the hoi polloi. The samples from Veru 
lamian with low lead values are believed to come from:
an impoverished fringe settlement of native Britons, undoubtedly "roman 
ized" in the sense of being under Roman rule and presumably aware of Ro 
man technology, but probably participating in it at a relatively humble level.
They may still have obtained their water from surface supplies or through
cheap wooden and earthenware pipes, and seldom enjoyed the praetorian
amenities of choice wine, "sugared" fruits, and other toxic delights. It is
clear that these Verulamians had a very different life-style from the inhabi 
tants of York and Cirencester, many of whom were likely to have been ex-

legionaries, militiamen, civil servants, or well-to-do tradesmen exposed to a
somewhat more elegant-and dangerous-cultural level. (Waldron and
Wells, 1979, p. 113)
The Poundbury bones show some evidence (typical of modern samples) of
an increase in lead concentration with age (Waldron et al., 1976).
After correcting for the differences in organic matter, blood, and water
contents, the mean lead levels of samples from the Romanic cemeteries at
Henley Wood, York, and Bath are found to be comparable to those of
modern bones. The levels for specimens from Poundbury and Cirencester
typically exceed the modern average several times over (see Waldron et
al., 1976, for details). The magnitude of the excess lead in the Romano 
British skeletons becomes evident when it is realized that the lead contents
of modern bones exceed those of ancient, non-lead-using cultures by fac 
tors of 10-100 or more (Grandjean, 1978; Ericson et al., 1979). There are
other relevant observations. The mean lead levels in the juvenile (15 years
or less) bones at Poundbury and Henley Wood are unusually high, aver 
aging about 80 and 70 ug/g, respectively, at the two sites (Waldron et al.,
1976). Compared to the petrous temporal bones in modern children that
often average less than 15 ug/g (Barry, 1978), "one must seriously consider
whether lead poisoning (acute or chronic) played some part in their death"
(Waldron et al., 1976, p. 226). The study of an interesting specimen of a
25-35-year-old woman found with the skeleton of a fetus still in her pelvis
gave the lead content of the mother's rib as 88 /-Lg/g, and that of the petrous
temporal bone of the fetus as 71 ug/g (Waldron et al., 1976). The data in 
dicate an unusually high transplacental passage of lead. "If it were repre 
sentative of the rate of placental transfer for the maternal population as a
whole, then some fetal damage would be inevitable, perhaps even to the
extent of causing the fetus to abort (or expire)" (Waldron et al., 1976,
p.227).
In a recent major study, Drasch (1982) analyzed about 650 bones from
a total of 332 individuals who lived during various times in the past, and
mostly in southern Bavaria. He demonstrated a strong age dependence in
the lead contents of the old bones (Fig. 6.1). He also showed that there is
a well-defined geographic difference in the lead contents of the prehistoric
bones (compare the data for the Peruvians with those of the prehistoric
Teutons in Table 6.5). The body burden of lead obviously depends on the
availability of lead in the individual's environment. Drasch (1982) noted a
significant increase in the average lead concentration in the bones of late
Roman age populations compared to the average level found in prehistoric
Bavarian populations (see Table 6.5). However, he reached the conclusion
that the lead content of the Roman age population is comparable to "that
found at Augsburg through the total Middle Age and at Regensburg from
the 12th century onwards [See Table 6.5]. From a similar way of life, it can
be concluded that the lead burden in ancient Rome was not significantly
higher in the capital than in the legion towns of Augsburg [italics are

mine]. Therefore the theory cannot be proven that a chronic lead intoxi 
cation at the late Roman Age was the main reason for the fall of the Roman
empire" (Drasch, 1982, p. 227). It is clearly fallacious to believe that the
extent of exposure to lead was the same in both Rome and the provinces.
Furthermore, the claim presumes that the bones he analyzed belonged only
to the aristocratic class. Little apparently is known about the social status
of the Roman Age individuals whose bones were analyzed. Interestingly
enough, Drasch's data show a marked binomial (or certainly skewed)
distribution:

Such a binomial or skewed distribution would be expected in a typical Ro 
man population where the well-to-do consumed the lead-contaminated
foods and are thus marked by elevated body burdens of lead. The possibil 
ity that the bones with high lead levels belonged to the Roman administra 
tors or possibly to the indigenous elites who lived like the affluent Romans
was not considered by Drasch (1982).
The analyses of the skeletal remains thus suggest-or at least they do
not disprove the suggestion-that the inhabitants of the Romanized towns
of Britain and southern Bavaria were exposed to dangerous levels of lead.
We can only suspect that the same is true of the contemporaneous popu 
lations in Rome and in the other provinces. Few reliable palaeontological
data pertaining to these groups are currently available. It is of more than
passing interest to compare the data in Table 6.4 (for the overexposed
Romano-Britons) with the median lead values of 0.2 p.g/gor less in the ver 
tebrae of Danes who lived between 4000 B.C. and-lOOO A.D., that is, from
the Stone Age to the Iron Age (Grandjean, 1975), or the mean values of
0.5-11~g/ggenerally found in the skeletal remains of pre-Columbian inhab 
itants in the Americas (Jarcho, 1964; Becker et al., 1968; Barry, 1978;
Ericson et al., 1979).
With the preceding epidemiological picture of lead poisoning among the
Roman aristocracy behind us, the chief purpose of this section can now be
discussed. Lead poisoning can be seen to have affected the vitality of Ro 
man culture in two fundamental ways: It ruined the reproductive capacity
of the ruling class*, and it macerated their ability to govern effectively. The
first phenomenon has been discussed extensively in the literature (e.g., Ko 
bert, 1909; Gilfillan, 1965), but the latter feature has received scant
attention.
The one incontestable historical fact about the Roman aristocracy is that
its ranks declined quite rapidly during the last century of the Republic and
during the early centuries of the Empire (Balsdon, 1962, 1969; Boren,
*The abortifactant properties of lead salts have been known since antiquity. A
large body of clinical data has since been obtained that shows that exposure to
moderate and high doses of lead can engender reproductive failures both in males
and females (see reviews by Rom, 1976; Bell and Thomas, 1980). There are the
numerous and well-known anecdotal reports on the higher incidence of sterility,
miscarriages, and stillbirths in women employed in lead-processing factories (Ham 
ilton and Hardy, 1974; Rom, 1976). The teratogenicity of lead in humans, as evi 
denced by an increased incidence of fetal macrocephaly, has been documented
(Rennert, 1881; Oliver, 1911). The toxic effects of lead on the male reproductive
system include teratospermia, hypsospermia, asthenospermia, and infertility (Lan 
cranjan et al., 1975; Bell and Thomas, 1980). The undue vulnerability of newborns
to lead is documented by numerous case reports of mental retardation, imbecility,
convulsions, and high mortality rates among the offspring of parents with lead poi 
soning (Rennert, 1881; Oliver, 1911; Nogaki, 1957; Hamilton and Hardy 1974).

<p>Lead Poisoning and the Decline of the Roman Empire 409
1977). Beginning at the time of Julius Caesar, the complexion of Senate
membership changed from one of distinguished families, whose names
were featured on every page of the history of the Republic, to one com 
posed of a steadily increasing number of men from new families who were
not native to Rome (Balsdon, 1969). Tacitus (3.55) observed that during
Vespasian's time, only an occasional knight or senator did not betray a ser 
vile origin. By the age of Hadrian, the famous Cornelii appear to be the
only surviving members of a strictly patrician family (Davis, 1967).
Ancient historical records leave ample evidence about the common in 
fecundity of the aristocracy during this period. The oversexed Julius Cae 
sar had only one daughter from his first wife, and no offspring at all from
his subsequent two marriages. The marriage of Augustus (then Octavian)
to Livia in 39 B.C. produced no issue. Trajan and Plotina had no children,
and the same is true of Hadrian and Sabina. The marriage of Scipio Ae 
milianus and Sempronica, the sister of Tiberius Gracchus, ended in disas 
ter because there were no children (Appian Bella civilia 1.83). Caligula and
Caesonia had only one daughter, and Titus' two marriages produced one
child-Julia (Birley, 1976). Ovid married four times, but he had only one
surviving daughter. Pliny (7.39) observed that there were many marriages
that produced no children or just one child, and the history of this period
abounds with these kinds of examples. Of the 35 married men who lived in
the aristocratic quarters in Roman Troy (Ilion), 18 were childless, 10 had
only one offspring, and 7 had two or three children (Gilfillan, 1965). "From
the numerous inscriptions which show rich men and women bequeathing
the whole of their property to their freedmen, freedwomen or the state, it
is reasonably inferred that these are cases of men and women who left no
children" (Balsdon, 1962, p. 194). The absence of a male heir might en 
courage the wife to resort to potions, charms, and spells to induce concep 
tion, while the husband-confident of his own virility-might sue for di 
vorce with the expectation of better success with another woman. During
the Empire period, we are told repeatedly that many "a couple has sepa 
rated, married elsewhere, separated again, and then resumed the old wed 
lock. Women are charged with flitting from one home to another, wearing
out the bridal veil; and indeed, spicy instances are cited of ladies who
boasted eight husbands in five autumns, a fact worthy of commemoration
on their tombs; or of reckoning the years not by. the annual consuls but by
their annual husbands" (Davis, 1967, p. 74).
It is an historically documented fact that using the legal precedent estab 
lished by Caesar, the early emperors occasionally created new patrician
families as a mitigative measure against the disappearance of the older
ones (Boren, 1977, p. 163). Augustus, who managed to have only a daugh 
ter, resorted to punitive laws aimed at the aristocratic bachelors. In a re 
lated action, Julius Caesar, and then Augustus, extended special privi 
ledges (the so-called jus trium liberorum) to fathers of three or more
children. Equally revealing is that in spite of the very large number of

bachelors and widespread extramarital relationships, we find that bastards
are rarely mentioned among the truly patrician families (Balsdon, 1969). Il 
legitimate births, by contrast, are noted among the less-noble families, as
is evidenced by Juvenal's (9.70-90) anecdote about a client who boasted
that-thanks to his services-his impotent master could claim paternity to
three children. Satirists attacked with sinister relish the many cases of sons
of reputable men who bore uncanny resemblances to famous actors, glad 
iators, or to members of the household staffs (Balsdon, 1962, p. 198).
Various hypotheses have been formulated to explain the tragic sterility
of the Roman aristocracy during the Empire period (e.g., see Balsdon,
1962, 1969; Gilfillan, 1965; Himes, 1970). Lead poisoning could easily have
caused such a widespread phenomenon of infecundity.
Miscarriages and stillbirths were distressingly frequent during this pe 
riod (Balsdon, 1962, 1969). For example, Caesar's daughter Julia, who was
married to Pompey, suffered a miscarriage and later died in childbirth.
Domitian's wife must have lost her child, since the expected heir never
was born (Martial 3.6). Pliny the Younger's (Letters, p. 10) third wife suf 
fered a miscarriage. In this connection, the embryotoxicity of lead needs
to be remembered.
Infant mortality was high in all levels of Roman society. The inauspi 
cious marriage of Julia, the daughter of Augustus, to Tiberius resulted in
one child that died in infancy (Seutonius Tiberius 7.3), as did the only son
of the emperor Domitian (Balsdon, 1962, p. 196). Nero's only child, a
daughter, died before she was four months old (Tacitus 15.23). The histo 
rian Tacitus (Agricola, 6.3) notes that Agricola, whom Nero's daughter
later married, was overjoyed at the birth of a daughter following the loss
of their first son. After successive losses of five children, Fronto (De nep
amisso 2.1) lamented: "I never had a child born to me except when be 
reaved of another." Only 3 of the 12 children of Tiberius Gracchus and
Cornelia survived (Plutarch Lives 1.7), and there are inscriptions that sug 
gest that for every child that attained adulthood, three had died before the
age of 3 (Balsdon, 1969). Factors likely to account for the heavy toll of
infant mortality in ancient societies include malnutrition and lack of proper
medical attention. Such conditions are unlikely to have caused such a de 
bilitating loss of numbers in the membership of the Roman aristocracy,
however, considering the patronage of the best and most famous doctors
by well-to-do families (see Brock, 1929). There must be other contributing
factors to the distressingly high infant mortality in the upper classes of so 
ciety. One tentative explanation that comes readily to mind is hereditary
lead poisoning. The profound effect of parental plumbism on the viability
of the offspring has been well documented in recent times (see Rennert,
1881; Oliver, 1911; Hamilton and Hardy, 1974).
The results of hereditary lead poisoning often include permanent mental
or physical damage. If lead is indeed implicated in the weakening of the
Roman nobilitas, one would expect the progeny of the great men to be
Lead Poisoning and the Decline of the Roman Empire 411
mainly imbeciles and underachievers. Aelius Spartianus (late third to early
fourth centuries A.D.)-one of the six putative biographers who wrote the
Lives of the Later Caesars (Birley, 1976)-provides a succinct answer to
this question:
Indeed, when I reflect on the matter, it is sufficiently clear that no great man
has left a son who is excellent and useful. For such men either die without
children or for the most part have children of such a kind that it would have
been better for the human race if they had died without descendants....
What of Scipio? What of the Catos, who were such great men? And then,
what shall I say about Homer, Demosthenes, Virgil, Crispus [Sallust] and
Terence, Plautus and all the rest? What about Caesar? What about Tullius
[Cicero], for whom especially it would have been better not to have had chil 
dren? What about Augustus, who did not even have a good son by adoption,
although he had the power of choosing from all men? Trajan himself, also,
made a mistake in choosing his fellow-townsman and nephew. But to omit
adoptive sons, lest the Antonines, Pius and Marcus, divine spirits of the re 
public, occur to us, let us turn to real sons. What would have been more for 
tunate for Marcus than not to have Commodus as his heir? What more for 
tunate for Severus Septimus, than not to have Bassianus?-who straightaway
destroyed his brother, supposed to have designed a conspiracy against him 
self, a fratricidal contrivance; who took his stepmother-and what step 
mother? rather she was his mother!-to wife, in whose bosom he had killed
her son Geta; who killed Papinian, sanctuary of the law and treasury of legal
learning. . .."
There is no denying the fact that the decimation of the Roman aristocracy
was caused by several interrelated factors. For example, progressive de 
cline in the ranks of the nobilitas has been attributed variously to the pe 
rennial wars, the plague and other diseases, moral decadence that encour 
aged bachelorhood and childlessness, celibacy brought on by the Christian
religion, the preoccupation with marrying money (a rich widow or the only
daughter of a rich family was at a premium) or into political prominence,
the widespread incidence of homosexuality, birth control, abortion or in 
fantile exposure, general organismic senescence or apathy, and political
tyranny (see Seeck, 1901; Frank, 1916; Spengler, 1926-1928; Boak, 1955;
Balsdon, 1962, 1969; Himes, 1970; Kagan, 1978). There is really no une 
quivocal evidence to justify any of the preceding claims (e.g., see Gilfillan,
1965; Balsdon, 1962, 1969). If anything, the roles of any or all of these fac 
tors can be regarded as supervenient to the effects of de facto lead
poisoning.
"Aristothanasia" must have been calamitous to Roman civilization. The
principal weakness of the oligarchy of the late Republic was its failure to
continue to admit substantial numbers of "new men" from the indigenous
Italian middle class into the governing elite of the state. Until about the
time of the Empire period, very limited use was made of mercenaries, and
the aristocracy certainly was expected to supply all the required military
and political leaders. With the progressive decline in the ranks of the no-

bilitas came an increasing reliance on the provincial equites to fill higher
posts in the military and government. This failure of the long-sustained en 
ergy and creative power of the members of the dominant minority (i.e., the
patrician families) probably marks the onset of the cancer that ultimately
led to the disintegration of the Empire (Gilfillan, 1965; Rostovtzeff, 1957;
Butzer, 1980).
Quite apart from any negative impact of lead poisoning on the reproduc 
tion of the aristocratic oligarchy and on the creative ingenuity of the prog 
eny, the affliction of those in power by the so-called "aping" disease con 
tributed to the Fall of Rome in another important aspect: It ushered in
ineffective leadership and the attendant sensitiveness to criticism and libel.
Many leaders became targets of treason (maiestas) charges. The glimpses
of the life-styles and the psychological profiles we have of the Julio 
Claudian, Adoptive, and Antonine emperors (roughly 30 B.C. to 225 A.D.)
definitely suggest that many of them could have been distempered by lead
poisoning. Among the Julio-Claudian emperors, Claudius (reigned: 41-54
A.D.) probably suffered severe clinical lead poisoning. He had disturbed
speech, weak limbs, an ungainly gait, tremors, fits of excessive and inap 
propriate laughter, and unseemly anger, and he often slobbered (Seutonius
Claudius 21, 30; Juvenal 6.622; Cassius Dio 60.2). The pathogenesis of
Claudius' ailments has been a matter of long-standing debate (see Moss,
1963; Grant, 1975). Even if the previously mentioned syndromes do not
pertain to hereditary lead poisoning, Claudius also suffered recurrent at 
tacks of stomachache (dry gripe) that were so fierce, he complained, that
they almost drove him to suicide (see Grant, 1975, p. 129). His contracting
of plumbism would not be surprising, since he was an intemperate glutton:
He was eager for food and drink at all times and in all places. Once when he
was holding court in the Forum of Augustus and had caught the savour of a
meal which was being prepared for the Salii in the Temple of Mars hard by,
he left the tribunal, went up where the priests were, and took his place at
their table. He hardly ever left the dining-room until he was stuffed and
soaked. Then he went to sleep at once, lying on his back with his mouth
open, and a feather was put down his throat to relieve his stomach. (Seuton 
ius Claudius 33,1)
He is reputed to have found some ray of wisdom at the bottom of an am 
phora (Sayer, 1853, p. 332).
Tiberius was an inveterate wine drinker, as well as being schizothymic
(Grant, 1975, p. 9; Esser, 1958). Caligula (Gaius) "was sound neither in
body nor mind. As a boy he was troubled with the falling sickness, and
while in his youth he had some endurance, yet at times because of sudden
faintness he was hardly able to walk, to stand up, to collect his thoughts,
or to hold up his head. He himself realized his mental infirmity, and
thought at times of going into retirement and clearing his brain" (Seutonius
Gaius 50). Perhaps this is indicative once more of hereditary lead poi-
soning, As an adult, he was a chronic alcoholic. His breakdown, which
caused his brain and reign to take a very decided turn for the worse, has
been attributed to overindulgence (and presumably lead poisoning as well):
In the eighth month of his reign a serious illness attacked Caligula who had
exchanged the more moderate, and therefore healthier, mode of life which he
ha.d f?llowed hitherto, during Tiberius' lifetime, for a life of luxury. Heavy
drinking and a taste for delicacies, an appetite insatiable even on a swollen
stomac?,~otbaths at the wrong time, emetics followed immediately by fur 
ther dnnkmg and gluttony which goes with it, indecent behavior with boys
and women, and all the vices which destroy soul and body and the bonds
which unite them, attacked him simultaneously. The wages of self-control are
health and strength, while those of a lack of self-control are weakness and an
illness which may prove fatal. (Philo Embassy to Gaius [Caligula], 11, 14)
Nero-notorious for setting Rome ablaze and punishing the Christians for
it-was also intemperate, prodigal, immoral, pleasure loving, and cruel
(Seutonius Nero 51).
Vitellius has been described as "the slave of his body and his palate,"
which was propitious for contracting lead poisoning (Tacitus Histories
3.86). In his leisure time "he enjoyed coarse company, and frequented dis 
reputable bars. But what made him notorious was his appetite. He used to
drink a good deal, at midday as well as in the evening, but above all he
ate, enormously: and a good deal of his most outrageous overeating was
u~dertakenat the cost of others, as a ruinously expensive diner-out, espe 
cially after he became emperor. ... He himself survived well enough by
t~kingregular emetics. Some of his fellow-diners, however, had a tougher
time. One of them, Quintus Vibius Crispus, who often had to be host or
guest at these gigantic meals, was once compelled by illness to absent him 
self for some days from the convivial board. But this, he commented pri 
vately to an associate, had saved his life. "If I had fallen ill, I should have
died," he declared," (Seutonius Vitellius 13.2; Grant 1975, p. 198). Domi 
tian, the last of the Flavian emperors, washed his conscience clean of his
crimes by using the stream of wine that nightly ran from the fountains
(Cassius Dio 67, 9).
Nerva (35-98 A.D.) was inclined to be a heavy drinker of wine (Victor
de Caesars 13.10). And of Trajan it has been written (see Birley, 1976):
"It was a fault in him that he was a heavy drinker and also a pederast. But
he did not incur censure, for he never committed any wicked deed because
of this. He drank all the wine that he wanted and yet remained sober, and
in his relations with boys he harmed no one. It is reported that he tempered
his wine-bibbing by ordering that his requests for drink should be ignored
after long banquets." Hadrian was a gourmand, his favorite dish being
tetrapharmacum, or pentapharmacum, which consisted of sow's udder
pheasant,peacock, ham in pastry and wild boar (Hadrian in Lives ofth~
Later Caesars 20.11). Aelius Verus (or Ceionius Commodus) was a person
of joyous life and a renowned gourmand reputed to have had Apicius'
</p>

<p>414 Lead Exposure and Lead Poisoning References 415
cookbook always by his bed (Aelius in Lives 4.7). The free-spirited Lucius
Verus (or Commodus Verus Antoninus) is said to have displayed such
"great extravagance that after he returned from Syria he even set up a
cookshop at home, to which he used to resort after Marcus' banquets, with
all manner of base characters ministering to him. He is also said to have
played dice the whole night through, after he had taken up that vice in
Syria; and to have been so much a rival of Gaius [Caligula], Nero and Vi 
tellius in vices that he used to wander about at night through the taverns
and brothels, with his head covered with a common travelling-cap, carouse
with cheap-jacks and engage in brawls, concealing his identity; and often
people say, he returned after being beaten with his face bruised, and was
recognized in the taverns although he had hidden himself." (Lucius Varus
in Lives 4.9). Among other luxury trappings, he had a crystal goblet that
surpassed the capacity of any human draught (Lives 11.2). Such a life-style
most likely entailed overexposure to lead (Tannahill, 1970, p. 24).
Avidius Casius (Lives 4.3) was an avid wine drinker, eager for food, but
able to endure starvation. The notorious Commodus Antoninus (Lives 5.8)
led a life of orgiastic abandonment in'~hepalace-amidbanquets and
baths. He would drink until dawn, flitted through the taverns in the eve 
ning, and squandered the resources of the Roman Empire (Lives 4.1). Di 
dius Julianus became a glutton in his old age (Lives 9.2), and Pescennius
Niger was fond of wine and was of unrestrained licentiousness in other va 
rieties of desires (Lives 1.4, 6.2). Clodius Albinus was a glutton, so much
so indeed "that he used to consume a greater quantity of fruit than human
capacities permit. For he, when hungry, ate five hundred dried figs (called
callistruthiae by the Greeks), a hundred Campanian peaches, ten Ostian
melons, twenty pounds of Labican grapes, a hundred fig-peekers and four
hundred oysters. He however was moderate with wine-which Severus
denies, claiming that he was drunk even during the war. With his own peo 
ple he was never in agreement, either because of drunkenness, as Severus
says, or because of his acrimonious character." (Lives 11.6). Both Anton 
inus Caracallus (Lives 8.10) and Antoninus Geta (Lives 3.6) were lovers of
dainty dishes and wines that were variously flavored. Heliogabalus-the
last of the Antonines-spent his lifetime in search of pleasures. He is re 
puted to have even outdone both Apicius and Vitellius in the munificence
of his banquets. "He never dined for less than 100,000 sesterces, and
sometimes the total cost of his dinner exceeded 3 million sesterces." He
drank so prodigiously that people thought he had been drinking from a
swimming pool. His own kitchen invented many exotic dishes and blended
wines. He was mentally impaired (in my opinion, by lead in his diet), and
he refused to have children "in case one of them turned out to be thrifty"
(Heliogabalus in Lives 18.3-35.7). The ingravescence of voracious appe 
tites and intemperance continued throughout the lives of the hierarchical
principes.
The preceding account shows that roughly two thirds (18 out of 30) of
the emperors and usurpers who reigned between 30 B.C. (Augustus) and
220 A.D. (Elegabalus) had a predilection for lead-tainted Apician entrees
and Columellan wine blends. This figure basically is confirmed by Celsus
(4.24) who observed that most of the Roman emperors suffered from gout.
It may be assumed that a large number of their well-placed cohorts ac 
quired similar tastes. This continuing parade of unproductive ("aped" by
lead) rulers and administrators throughout this period of the Roman Empire
no doubt contributed immeasurably to social disequilibrium and economic
disaster.
Pundits obviously need to be reminded that hundreds of reasons have
been suggested for the collapse of the Roman Empire. In the classic his 
tory The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon (1776 
1788) listed over two dozen causes of the decline. Reasons often men 
tioned inlcude the following: economic stagnation, demographic decline
including manpower shortages, overexploitation of the masses and natural
resources, the inflexibility, or the monolithic nature, of the sociopolitical
system, the barbarization of the system, the rise of Christianity, ecological
stress, systemic senescence, and so on (see Bark, 1958; Remondon, 1964;
Jones, 1966; L'ot, 1966; Perowne, 1966; Macmullen, 1967; Vogt, 1967; Jor 
don, 1971; Grant, 1976; Kagan, 1978). In the final analysis, however, Rome
fell to easy-to-identify invasions from outside and weaknesses from within.
The present study of the production and use of lead-often referred to as
the "Roman" metal-by Roman culture strongly implicates lead poisoning
of the aristocratic oligarchy as one of the principal, probable causes of the
internal weaknesses. Kobert (1909) and Gilfillan (1965) had previously
reached the same basic conclusion.
