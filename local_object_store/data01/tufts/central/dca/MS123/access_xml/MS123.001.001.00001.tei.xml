	  <u who="AI">So one day my brother who used to live out here told me that my son was rude to one of the senior citizens out here.  Walter was a good kid, not saying because he's mine, but he was pretty good and I couldn't imaging him. I said, "Walter, were you rude to Mr. Bird?" </u>

	  <u who="AI">Mr. Bird was a darling.  So I spoke to my son, I didn't say, "Oh, no not my son," no. We had one mother out here who's like that, not her son.  I said, "Uncle George said Mr. Bird told him that you were rude to him.  What did you say to Mr. Bird?"</u>

	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_149" n="149" end="timepoint_150">
	  <u who="AI">So, he said, when I, Walter told me what had happened it wasn't, my son, my brother didn't know what my son had done. But when my son was talking to me apparently Mr. Bird had exagerated a little bit, but still he was such a wonderful gentleman that I couldn't imagine anybody being rude to him.</u>
	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_150" n="150" end="timepoint_151">
	  <u who="AI">So I punished my son, see, by not letting him go somewhere.  So another thing that my husband would do, see, now listen, my husband worked Saturdays for half a day.  He was not to go out until he had done his chores for the day, "now don't you holler and scream, he's not to go out," and he told me.</u>

	  <u who="AI">My son loved to read and we were all readers and he would read.  And we had a cat and he played with the cat.  And so some of the kids would come over here to play baseball and they'd say, "Oh, Mrs. Isaacs, Walter will do it next week?" and I'd say, "no, Mr. Isaacs said he's not to go out." <vocal desc="clears throat"/> Excuse me. "Until his work is done."</u>
	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_152" n="152" end="timepoint_153">
	  <u who="AI">So one day my son, my husband came home and Walter was still in the house <gap desc="inaudible"/> "Well, I'm going out."  My husband said, "You're going out where?"  "Well I did my work."</u>

	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_153" n="153" end="timepoint_154">
	  <u who="AI">He said "you know, it's four o'clock, it's about, almost time for you to come in."  He said, "you should have been out, on your way home."  He said, "no, your not going out."  Just like that.  And you, you talk to any child like that today.  And so that's, that's when I hear about 'your husband'.</u>

	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_154" n="154" end="timepoint_155">
	  <u who="AI">And, but that's what, that's, that's how it was.  He said, my daughter would get up in the morning  and she would do her work.  She had a little bit of ironing to do and 12 o'clock she was all through and she was out with her friends and he's listening to the radio and playing with the cat, poor thing.</u>
	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_155" n="155" end="timepoint_156">
	  <u who="AI">And my husband, I didn't say anything.  So, the children, they loved him, they really loved, loved their father, see.  "Daddy this" and "Daddy the other" and so forth and so on.  I was the one that was, I'm a little, a little harder.</u>

	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_156" n="156" end="timepoint_157">
	  <u who="AI">And my daughter and I, now, kind of clash sometimes but she's good, she's good to me.  So this is how our family was, and there were a lot of families around here too. That they, we were good families.</u>
